				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On page 306 of <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2018/04/scale-geoffrey-west/">Scale</a>, Geoffrey West discusses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&#8217;s Law</a> and its implication for human social networks. To summarize this law: it claims that humans have multiple levels of bonding strength. At the lowest level a human will have around five connections of the strongest type of friendship and intimacy. Typically this would include some members of one&#8217;s family or a best friend. At the next level there are around fifteen connections that are not as strong as the first level, but are still firm. This would include close friends you might talk to on a daily or weekly basis. At the next level there are about fifty connections&#8230; and so on&#8230; The numbers of connections scales by tripling the connections at each higher level. In the book the levels are labeled as: 1) Kin, 2) Super-family 3) Clan, 4) Tribe, and 5) Strangers.</p>
<p>When I first read this in Scale, I was immediately reminded of David Graeber&#8217;s anthropological work regarding economic relationships among humans. In his book <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2017/07/debt-the-first-5000-years-david-graeber/">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a>, Graeber observes on page 99-100 that baseline communism (sharing) follows a similar structure. Thus, using the terminology from above: At the kin level Graeber notes that there is much sharing between members and the relationship is baseline communism. Thus, you can extend this and map these economic relationships with those of Dunbar&#8217;s Law: 1) Kin (~5 people) : Almost all sharing with very little exchange, 2) Super-family (~15 people) : Exchange with a good amount of sharing, 3) Clan (~ 50 people) : Mostly exchange and little sharing, and 4) Tribe (~150 people) : Almost entirely exchange with very little sharing. Anything outside the tribe would be pure exchange except in rare occasions, such as a child falling in front of a on coming vehicle (a person would naturally share his strength to save the child&#8217;s life). Although I may not have followed Graeber&#8217;s observations exactly and I wonder how I can add debt to this mapping, I find this train of thought to be interesting as it requires one to rethink the concept of currency, exchange, and economic relationships. Indeed, Graeber&#8217;s book challenges the entire paradigm of the historical development of currency and debt by analyzing the anthropological record.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://a.co/0tTatb5">Scale</a>, by Geoffrey West, is a thought provoking book about coarse grained quantitative network theories which concern the entire human species and its interaction with the environment. Although verbose &#8212; as I think the intended audience is upper high school and entry-level college &#8212; it is clear in its depictions and explanations. This book is an important summary of really profound work and research performed at the Santa Fe Institute. And it is a great introduction to understanding power laws and scaling in biology and network topologies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been following Bitcoin since 2011 but sadly never researched its technical foundations. A few weeks ago I decided to dive into the subject. <a href="http://a.co/4VbZiYq">Mastering Bitcoin</a>, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, clearly explains the fundamental designs of Bitcoin. The book is well written and an excellent entry point for developers new to the subject. Many sites and people recommend this book and rightly so, because after reading it, I feel that I have a new understanding and appreciation of everything blockchain related. While it is detailed and technical &#8212; geared towards an audience familiar with programming and Internet technologies, it can be a great resource for those wanting an intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>If you decide to purchase the book, make sure you do it on <a href="https://purse.io/shop">purse.io</a> with Bitcoin. Purse is now where I make any purchases for books or things I would have bought directly from Amazon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.anthonypeake.com/product/opening-the-doors-of-perception/">Opening the Doors of Perception</a>, Anthony Peake strings together research in epilepsy, migraines, autism, Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, schizophrenia, and entheogens in an attempt to understand human consciousness. Are we living in a simulation? What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction">Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)</a> and what can it tell us about ourselves? How is it that flickering light can trigger an altered state of consciousness? What is the relationship between the Eidolon and the Daemon? These are just some of the questions pondered and developed by Peake. Opening the Doors of Perception provides the reader with some fascinating research which will hopefully open ones mind to some really powerful insights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be greatly beneficial to human communication freedom if we all worked together to create a decentralized blockchain wireless internet provider network. I think there are already at least two projects addressing this idea: <a href="https://www.dentwireless.com/whitepaper">DENT</a> and <a href="https://iungo.network/">IUNGO.NETWORK</a>. I am still reading the whitepapers for these projects. Before searching for existing projects based on this idea, I imagined a decentralized blockchain where each node in the network operates a wireless access point. And the data sent and received would be computed and deducted from a users wallet. Ideally, a person would be able to purchase a given amount of coins on an exchange which could then be used to exchange for a certain amount of wireless data. There are similarities with SIA coin, etc&#8230; where the blockchain provides a decentralized service with security. The key is decentralization, anonymity, security, privacy, and freedom.</p>
<p>There are other options, but not what I have in mind: <a href="https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh">goTenna</a>, <a href="https://www.opengarden.com/firechat.html">FireChat</a>, etc&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little bit of quantum physics, chemistry, biology and philosophy all rolled up into one important book. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783285.Order_Out_of_Chaos"><em>Order Out of Chaos</em></a> (<em>La Nouvelle Alliance</em> as originally published in French) by Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers is a paradigm changing book. The first parts of the book are an excellent overview on the historical development of science &#8211; the evolution of dynamics and the discovery of thermodynamics and their relationship is particularly fascinating.</p>
<p>Once the reader gets to the later parts, it becomes somewhat abstract and the reader may not be able to get through it without a background in chemistry and physics. Chapter Nine, when the phrase &#8220;Order Out of Chaos&#8221; is developed, is difficult. Despite this, it is much more accessible than a scientific paper on the subject. It may take two or three reads to fully absorb the ideas presented. Overall it is one of my favorite reads.</p>
<p>Some important conclusions from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>The arrow of time objectively exists and it arises from non-equilibrium and irreversibility at the microscopic level.</li>
<li>The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics can be understood as a selection principal. It operates as a negative on allowable initial conditions, in other words it restricts systems with certain initial conditions from existing.</li>
<li>Time travel to the past is not allowed by thermodynamics because time reversal requires infinite information concerning the initial conditions of the system, an impossibility to an observer in the universe. This implies that information is closely connected to irreversibility and time.</li>
<li>Thermodynamics can be expressed from dynamics through the idea of correlations and internal-time operators. Thus, dynamics has been extended once again (general relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos theory).</li>
<li>The universe as a whole is in a non-equilibrium state and it is an irreversible process with pockets of reversible dynamics.</li>
<li>In general, one of the goals of the authors is to make dynamics and thermodynamics consistent with each other.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8URhgYos5fjHqFSO4RSIEg">Hidden Forces</a>, hosted by Demetri Kofinas is an nice set of interviews with various people on topics including: finance, complexity, mathematics, and cryptocurrencies. I struggled listening to some of the interviewees because I did not agree with their ideas or conclusions; but I guess it is good to have conflicting opinions in order to encourage debate in the comments and to help review one&#8217;s own opinions and understandings. Regardless, Kofinas provides a highly accessible medium through which advanced ideas can be grasped.</p>
<p>I first ran across Hidden Forces while listening to the <a href="https://youtu.be/NxERVnvHV4c">interview with Ray Monk</a> about philosophical mathematics. Monk&#8217;s narration on the work of Frege, Russell, Whitehead, Wittgenstein, and Gödel is excellent &#8211; by far one of the clearest and easiest to grasp. It was learning about these paradigms and paradoxes of mathematics via <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2012/12/godel-escher-bach-douglas-hofstadter/">Hofstadter&#8217;s famous book</a> which led me to start this website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Zukav&#8217;s book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dancing_Wu_Li_Masters">The Dancing Wu Li Masters</a>, <em>simply</em> describes (without math) quantum physics and relativity since their inception at the beginning of the 20th century.

<p>There are numerous analogies with eastern cosmologies which may help readers understand the wild results and conclusions of modern physics. The book is perfect for those without a strong background in the quantitative sciences who wish to understand what quantum physics reveals about the universe. Although dated, (1979) it is inspirational and should get readers excited about reading more up to date books.</p>

<li>CB<sub>1</sub> is the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain</li>
<li>Cannabinoids modulate how fast things move through the gut!</li>
<li>CB<sub>1</sub> is the &#8220;psychoactive receptor&#8221; and CB<sub>2</sub> is the immunomodulatory receptor</li>
<li>CBs 10-fold more potent than morphine in WDR neurons mediating pain</li>
<li>All humans have a baseline Endocannabinoid System, influenced by genetics or some life event; in some people the system becomes deficient &#8211; disease and other issues arise in the body</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me provide a context so that you may understand my amazement with the chemical explorations of Alexander Shulgin. Did you know that the two principal neurotransmitters in the human body are dopamine and serotonin? Did you know that they belong to the phenethylamine and tryptamine chemical families, respectively? I find this simple observation to be of fundamental importance in understanding the human mind/body relationship. And now consider that Ann and Alex Shulgins&#8217; books: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL">PiKHAL</a> (Phenethylamines I have known and loved) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiHKAL">TiKHAL</a> (Tryptamines I have known and loved) explore both these chemical families and their effects on the human mind and body. Quick summary of well-known psychedelic chemicals:</p>

</table>
<p>LSD is complex and has both chemical structures, but most people emphasize that the effects of LSD are related primarily to its tryptamine backbone and interaction with human serotonin receptors.</p>
<p>Ann and Alexander Shulgin&#8217;s books are a groundbreaking revelation for their accounts of psychedelic exploration, therapy, and spiritual development. They are a mix of essays and stories. You will not regret reading the books and learning about the chemicals referenced in the second half of the books.</p>
<p>An interesting note: In PiKHAL, the fictional character Adam Fisher is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Zeff">Leo Zeff</a>, a talented psychotherapist who worked with MDMA; you can read all about his therapy work in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2750163-the-secret-chief-revealed">The Secret Chief Revealed</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Stolaroff">Myron J. Stolaroff</a>.</p>
