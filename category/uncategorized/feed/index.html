				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last few weeks developing a new website with <a href="//www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play Framework</a>. Hosted by Red Hat via Openshift, <a href="//www.thebubbleindex.com/" target="_blank">The Bubble Index</a> now allows anyone to download the most recent PDF on various indices,  stocks, currencies, and commodities. However, only about fifty PDF files  are published on the website as of January 7th; most are a few months  old. I now have all the daily data in the correct format (thanks to the <a href="//nasir.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/ruby-gem-for-finance-data/" target="_blank">yahoo RUBY GEM</a> and lots of BASH scripts) to be ran through The Bubble Index  application. In the next few weeks, I should be able to upload a Bubble  Index for all the S&amp;P 500 stocks.<br />The goal of the site is to host all 500 S&amp;P stocks, 15 major  indices, 10 currencies and 10 commodities; which are all updated at  least once a week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should post all my miscellaneous explorations within the Internet and Life. &nbsp;Perhaps they may be of interest to someone. The main topic I wish to post concern all of the books I read. The other topics will be random. &nbsp;For instance, when I have the desire to purchase various products, I spend a lot of time in search of reviews. In the process I end up discovering new items and fascinating articles on all sorts of subjects. I hope these findings will be of interest.</p>
