				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Stock prices, as seen by many appear to be purely random processes with no patterns and thus no predictability. And more often than not, people unfamiliar with stochastic processes will equate the work of financial engineers as &#8220;hocus-pocus,&#8221; &#8220;rocket science,&#8221; or just plan gambling. Are these people correct? Are asset managers playing roulette with the public&#8217;s money? If so, then it would seem that the life work of people such as Ito, Merton, Black, Scholes, Hull, Cox, White, Detemple, Sornette, and others amount to no more than speculation or the ramblings of an inmate in an insane asylum. Assuming otherwise, and that there is method to the madness of these academics, prices are predictable. And stochastic calculus provides a framework with which to build predictions. But how well and how reliable are the calculations? How can we use this predictability to properly manage risk?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There are at least two important responsibilities for risk managers:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. Risk managers must make rational decisions. An empirical and purely quantitative forecast of future returns should be made with a clear understand of model assumptions.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. With the foresight provided by the model, a suitable strategy must be taken. If the observations are indicating current market bubble conditions, then managers should be selling, or at the very least not buying.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">These responsibilities are general and do not depend on the model being implemented to forecast returns. The accuracy of the forecast depends greatly on the assumptions used to create the model. The majority of models assume:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. That returns are independent in time.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. That volatility is constant.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3. That markets are efficient.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. That prices follow the Geometric Brownian Motion</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, most models assume that human emotions, psychology, and behavior are not factors in determining the price movements of assets. How can such critical factors be ignored by financial engineers? The number of papers dealing with the effects of behavior on stochastic equations are few. Instead, the academic community has and continues to brush off these factors with the wrongly conceptualized idea that the sum total of all human interactions will create Brownian Motion. The billions of collisions on a grain of pollen in H<sub>2</sub>O are what stirred the creation of this type of stochastic process. So, the question is: Can we equate the process which creates Browian Motion as observed by Brown himself, to the structure of asset price movement? One is created through thermal random thermal interactions; the other through human emotion, psychology, and behaviour.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Risk managers should realize these assumptions and they should be cautious.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If risk managers believe in the predicatablity of prices, then we must, by force of principle assume that there is an underlying structure. In other words, consider the prediction of Earthquakes. The fact that we even consider the ability to predict their occurrence suggests that we have some degree of knowledge regarding their underlying structure. By believing in the predictability of price trajectories, we naturally assume some underlying structure. But what is this structure? How do we monitor the processes at work?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Are returns predictable? According to much research, the answer to this question is a firm, yes. But arbitrage theory says that such predicatablity can not exist. So, what does the risk manager believe? Does he believe that prices are Brownian Motions; that markets are efficient machines, not affected by the emotions, psychology, and behavior of humans; or does he disregard these assumptions in search for a better stochastic model? The answer to this question lies in controversy and may not be resolved for a long time. However, the risk manager has 100 billion of assets which he must manage today. Where is he to look for alternative models which disregard the assumptions of his collegues and predecessors? This paper provides the beginning of one such alternative.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This paper presents a stochastic model of the form: change(price) = function(volume). The volume depends on a matrix with a fixed number of agents. The intuition behind this model comes from the concept that a stock price&#8217;s movement should reflect not a normal distribution, which has roots in the idea of Brownian motion and particles in heat transfer, but rather a bi-directional &#8220;tug-of-war&#8221; between agents who are buying and selling with human emotions, psychology, and behavior. Just as in the youthful tug-of-war game, there are times when it appears that the right side has the upper hand, when, all of the sudden the left side makes a determined effort and brings down the right side. These drastic and rapid phase transitions are unheard of in a Brownian idea of price movements. The Brownian application to asset price movements provide a decent first approximation. However, stochastic processes with Brownian Motion will never evolve in a manner to explain the stylized facts observed from the actual distribution of asset returns. Thus, to truly model price behavior, practitioners should study the fundamental structure of the market.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Consider this thought experiment:&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Take a snapshot of all market participants in a security XYZ. This is period zero (t = 0). Suppose there are a fixed number, N, total people in the financial system who can own and trade XYZ. In other words, the price movement of this asset should depend only on the actions of these N traders. Now count the number of traders who currently hold a short position in XYZ and a long position in XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub>and L<sub>0</sub> represent the number of traders who are currently short and long, respectively, the asset XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub> + L<sub>0</sub>&lt; N, thus there are a number of traders, H<sub>0</sub>, who hold neither a short nor a long position. Thus, H<sub>0</sub> = N – S<sub>0</sub>– L<sub>0</sub>. The current price of XYZ is P<sub>0</sub>. Assume that all transactions only involve 1 share of XYZ. Further posts will seek to address the important consideration of number of shares.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now consider the next possible moves for all traders in the market (t = 1). There are assumed to be four possibilities:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">An XYZ owner with a long position sells. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A trader short XYZ covers his/her position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a long position. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a short position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0 </sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, numbers 1 and 2 increase the number of neutral traders, while 3 and 4 decrease that number. Assume that both 2 and 3 cause the price of XYZ to increase by some factor and 1 and 4 decrease the price of XYZ by the same factor. Thus the movement of the price of XYZ should be a bi-directional “tug-of-war” battle: traders going long and shorts covering versus traders shorting and longs selling.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">To represent this computationally, a matrix can be created which holds the current state of all traders. To create the initial state matrix, called StateMatrix<sub>0</sub>, form an <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N x <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N square matrix (for simplification, it would be best to choose N as a perfect square). Then fill the matrix randomly with the value -1 for the correct number of traders short XYZ, S<sub>0</sub>. Do likewise with L<sub>0</sub>and H<sub>0</sub>, represented by 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, the initial StateMatrix<sub>0</sub> will be randomly filled with {-1,0,1}, representing the traders who are short, neutral, and long.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now, proceed one period to t = 1. To calculate the next StateMatix<sub>1</sub>, do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Assume that each trader is influenced by U of his peers and that this influence is proportional to a factor representing the general market “mood.” Call the mood factor for the current period, M<sub>t</sub>. To find what the trader will do in the transition from t = 0 to t =1, sum the values of his U neighbors, find their average, multiply by the current M<sub>t</sub> and round. In addition, include a possibility for&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;to form his own&nbsp;independent value {-1,0,1} and ignore his U neighbors with probability, IDIO (an idiosyncratic change of asset position).</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For example, suppose that at t = 0, trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> of the matrix was short, i.e. the value was -1 and that his 4 neighbors at i = 0 had values {1,0,1,-1}.&nbsp;Suppose the M<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;at this time is 1.2 and IDIO = 0.20. If this&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;does not choose an idiosyncratic position, then he mimics his neighbors.&nbsp;The sum of his four neighbors is thus&nbsp;SumTrader<sub>[i,j]</sub> = 1 + 0 + 1 – 1 = 1 and the average is ¼. Thus ¼*1.2 = 0.3. Rounding give a value of 0. Thus, the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> should change his value to 0, in other words the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> will cover his position.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Performing this calculation for every trader on the grid will create the StateMatrix<sub>1</sub>. And doing this for T periods will create a&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence of trader states. To calculate the actual price movement based on this&nbsp;model do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Calculate the difference,&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>and divide by N. Multiply by P<sub>t</sub>. This value = C, the change in the price from the previous price</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Price<sub>t+1</sub> = Price<sub>t</sub>+ C</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">This will form the evolution of the price through the states of the&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence.  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Note: In order to make the M<sub>t</sub>factor suitable, its values must fall between [0,1.5). If not, then values of the traders<sub>[i,j]</sub> may be other than {-1,0,1}. The M<sub>t</sub> factor can be calculated at each period with the following calculation:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">M<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;= #L<sub>t-1</sub>/#S<sub>t-1</sub></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the Mood factor M<sub>t</sub>for the next period is the ratio of the number of current traders who are long to the number of current traders who are short. There may be other ways to define this factor.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Look at the previous <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/11/simulated-stock-price-data-ising-type.html" target="_blank">post, here</a>, to see an example. In that post I used:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">N = 1,000,000</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">T = 700</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">U = 4</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">L<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">IDIO = 0.19</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">The works of Didier Sornette and others show that Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) oscillations occur before financial crashes. Implementing the ideas found in various papers, the following graphs were created. As can be seen from the following graphs, peaks in the periodogram signals occurs shortly before some of the crashes.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">I created a blog devoted to exploring these LPPL market signals: <a href="//lpplmarketwatch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">LPPL Market Watch</a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Update: new website devoted to this subject. Visit: <a href="//www.thebubbleindex.com/" target="_blank">The Bubble Index</a>.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Summary of Research</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Recent research by Didier Sornette and his colleagues suggests that market crashes are predictable phenomenon. Even though economists debate the existence of crashes and their precursors &#8211; bubbles, &nbsp;there exists historical proof of Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) oscillations occurring immediately before all recorded major market declines in all major stock indices. For example, these LPPL oscillations occurred in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 shortly before the crashes of 1929, 1987, and 2000.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">With the aide of Sornette’s previous papers on market crashes, a “bubble index” is created. The bubble index displays the likelihood of a market bubble at any given time. With an index like this as a tool, any investment strategy which seeks to time the market will be highly successful. The bubble index indicates when to change asset positions in preparation for an incoming crash. One application of the bubble index is for financial planners and investment managers to change their client’s asset allocations accordingly. As the bubble index spikes, a crash is near. After the crash occurs the bubble index returns to low levels, indicating that the crash is over.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">A bubble index for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 is formed with the methods presented in this paper. Remarkably, the 1929, 1962, 1987, and 2000 crashes are all predicted at least a week before the actual crash. In the weeks prior to these crashes there is a large spike in the index. After the crash occurs, the index returns to low levels. Interestingly, the bubble index for these indices only spikes during a crash. In other words, given that a spike has occurred, there is a 100% probability that a crash has or will occur. However, some of the crashes are not predicted by spikes in the bubble index. For instance, In both indices the 1968, 1972, and the 2008 crash show no spike in the index before or during the event.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">These LPPL signals indicate that crashes are not related to changes in technology, culture, economic policies, etc&#8230; In other words, financial markets have patterns which suggest an underlying structural instability during crashes. This supports Sornette&#8217;s belief that financial crashes are critical&nbsp;phenomena&nbsp;resulting from the complex interactions of traders. To me, this suggests that the natural sciences have a key place in finance.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">The implications of these results are rather enormous, since the index is simple to create and understand. The ability to leave the market before a crash and enter after the event provides a wonderful opportunity to earn excess returns while preserving capital. This bubble index should be run on a daily basis to allow an investment manager or financial planner to gain an awareness of current stability conditions. If the bubble index is widely viewed and accepted as a legitimate and reliable forecast of bubbles and crashes, then crash prevention may be possible at the macro level.</div>

<p><span style="text-align: justify;">Modelling market returns as independent random variables/martingales is the same as modelling the solar system as a geocentric system with the planets and Sun circling around Earth in epicycles. Predictions of the future are <a href="//www.voxeu.org/article/failed-forecasts-and-financial-crisis-how-resurrect-economic-modelling" target="_blank">often vastly incorrect</a> in both models. Quite surprisingly, this solar system model survived for thousands of years, despite it being totally incorrect. Then came Tycho Brahe who introduced a modified version of this </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy" target="_blank">Ptolemaic system</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. In Brahe&#8217;s model the planets orbit the Sun which orbits the Earth. While this model improved the accuracy of planetary motions, it failed to model reality. Perhaps it could be said that stochastic jump processes are equivalent to Brahe&#8217;s model of the solar system. While these jump process do a better job at modelling the returns than simple stochastic processes, they fail to grasp the underlying true model of returns.</span></p>

<p>And as we now know, the true model (for now) of the solar system was introduced by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos" target="_blank">Aristarchus</a> (Copernicus and Kepler helped bring forward this model) and predicts planetary motions with near perfection and represents the actual state of the solar system. I believe that the analogous model for stock returns has been introduced by <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/02/didier-sornette-predicting-risk.html">Didier Sornette</a>, Anders Johanson and others.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">These scientists have expounded the idea that market returns are a function of individual agents in a complex system. Just as the human body is a collection of individual cells which make &#8220;decisions&#8221; based on communications with neighbours through chemical processes, traders make their own decisions based on communication with neighbours. With this perspective the <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/01/avoiding-stock-market-crash-and-perhaps.html" target="_blank">market is a complex system</a> of interacting agents. Thus, returns should be a function of these interactions. Under this complex system model, bubbles and crashes which dot the history of finance (which are not explained fully by independent returns/martingales) are straightforward results. In addition, these models still explain why returns are close to normal &#8220;most&#8221; of the time.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">So, it seems that we need to modify or throw away the old models in favour of these new complex system models. These complex models offer better prediction of the overall market and more fully represent reality.</p>
<p>There is the interesting possibility of this: the stochastic volatility model referred to as the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein-Uhlenbeck</a> process represents the physical process of a &#8220;noisy relaxation process.&#8221; The Wiener Process represents Brownian motion or motion of a particle through a gas or liquid. So, if we consider the movement of a stock through a virtual container of many stocks (these stocks are the atoms in the Brownian motion) then we need to ask ourselves: What does the price, interest rate, returns, etc. mimic? It is NOT the equations! BUT the physical processes themselves.  Why is an interest rate in a state of disequilibrium in the first place&#8230; that it must try to relax? Who put the stock in swarm of human hands all independently moving&#8230; It more correctly seems that the traders are following its movement at every second, waiting to grab it when the time if right (thus not independent)?</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">The idea in <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-stock-markets-crash-didier-sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Why Stock Markets Crash</i></a> is that there exists a critical point which represents the boundary between two regimes. The entire stock market exists as numerous agents whose decisions are not independent.  These agents are in a state of disorder under &#8220;normal&#8221; trading conditions, thus creating return distributions which are normally distributed. As time progresses the market rises and the agents begin to enter a state bordering disorder and order.  While in this state, the market attitudes of the agents can be abstracted to fractal islands just like the <a href="//link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjb%2Fe2006-00391-6?LI=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ising model</a> when close to criticality; in this state, attitudes are able to percolate through various hierarchies and organizations. I have left out many details, but the general concept is that once the market reaches this state, the probability for a crash becomes large; in other words, a crash is the result of instabilities caused by agents reaching a critical state.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">My question is this: If market agents realize the instability and expect a crash, will the crash be avoided?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps there exists a critical proportion of agents who must expect the crash for it to be avoided. If a small number of agents expect the crash, then it will still occur. If more than the critical number of agents expect the crash, it will be avoided. But, if so many agents share the same attitude, doesn&#8217;t that make  the market even more unstable? With all this order, there will be opportunities for arbitrage. As attitudes flip-flop and cascade through the system, this arbitrage opportunity will occur again and again; faster and faster; this creates the observed log-periodic oscillations. Eventually, the crash occurs. My conclusion seems to be that a crash can not be avoided.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">People say that in reality there is no arbitrage. They believe that any pattern which arises will be quickly removed. BUT, isn&#8217;t the removal of a pattern a pattern itself? Perhaps similar to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hofstadter&#8217;s</a> Figure and Ground? Caution: some Grounds are not themselves Figures. I believe that the ideas presented by <a href="http://www.er.ethz.ch/about-us/people/sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sornette</a> may be the pattern of pattern removal. Perhaps there can be strategies based on the removal of a pattern, which is based on the removal of a different pattern&#8230; and so forth.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The potential for crash prevention has applications in societal collapse. My intuition tells me that the two are related. If we can answer the question: Can we prevent the crash of a market? Then we will know the answer to the question: Can we prevent the collapse of a society? To me this seems deeply connected with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isaac Asimov&#8217;s</a> <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/foundation-isaac-asimov.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation Series</a>. In this series <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hari Seldon</a> develops psychohistory (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Wikipedia</a>):</div>

It works on the principle that the behaviour of a mass of people is predictable if the quantity of this mass is very large (equal to the population of the galaxy, which has a population of quadrillions of humans, inhabiting millions of star systems). The larger the number, the more predictable is the future.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It seems that Asimov is once again ahead of his time!</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">I recently read <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/phase-transitions-and-signs-of-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Phase Transitions</i></a>, by <a href="//complex.upf.es/~ricard/Main/RicardSole.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricard Sole</a>. The last chapter talks about societal collapse due to resource depletion. Under some assumptions, modelling the per capita consumption rate of natural resources shows that there exists a phase transition between stability and collapse. In other words, a gradual increase in the per capita consumption rate (or an increase in population, given a fixed per capita consumption rate) will result in a sudden and extreme phase shift &#8212; from stability to instability, i.e. collapse.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, the book <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-stock-markets-crash-didier-sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Why Stock Markets Crash</i></a>, by <a href="http://www.er.ethz.ch/about-us/people/sornette.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didier Sornette</a>, mentions the same phase transition, or critical point as he refers to it, occurring due to an increasing rate of population growth and dependence upon technology. The rate of population growth implies the occurrence of a finite time singularity. Upon reaching this critical point, a change from one regime into another will occur. What this change will be is unknown.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There have been numerous large civilizations of the past whose existence was relatively brief on the face of the Earth. Will modern civilization have the same fate? These two books suggest an impending change. However, there is a chance that this time could be different. No other society in history has been able to predict its own demise. Is this the key? The knowledge of one&#8217;s own collapse could be sufficient to prevent it.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I believe to at least postpone the arrival of this phase transition requires only that we have a full dependence on renewable resources and find a revolutionary way to produce and distribute fresh water. Once these are accomplished, other issues which could lead to collapse can be fixed in due time.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly, there already exist potential solutions which I believe can solve the problem: <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_fuel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algae Oil</a> and <a href="//books.google.com/books?id=uQQVJj_bPHcC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;ots=sqEg4mcCYU&amp;dq=Kumar%20%20Pandit%20water%20cavitation&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=Kumar%20%20Pandit%20water%20cavitation&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water Cavitation</a>. Growing algae in deserts near the ocean seems like a terrific idea for generating fuel. Not to mention the fact that the algae remove CO2 from the air. However, I can foresee that this could actually create a problem, since too little CO2 in the atmosphere is also a problem.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Water Cavitation, as mentioned in the link above, provides a reliable mechanism for removing chemicals and organisms from water. A perfect source of clean, fresh water for the world. However, there still exists the problem of water availability. Perhaps there are good ideas for this, I am not sure.</div>

		<description><![CDATA[Origins of Order, by Stuart Kauffman, provides a new look at evolution through natural selection. Instead of holding that the main creator of order is genetic drift with Natural Selection, Kauffman explores the idea that order can spontaneously form under various&#160;conditions&#160;in the natural world. Kauffman also&#160;emphasizes&#160;the importance of&#160;co-evolution&#160;among organisms in creating complex&#160;evolutionary&#160;systems. All of these [&#8230;]]]></description>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><i><a href="//amzn.com/0195079515" target="_blank">Origins of Order</a></i>, by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman" target="_blank">Stuart Kauffman</a>, provides a new look at evolution through natural selection. Instead of holding that the main creator of order is genetic drift with Natural Selection, Kauffman explores the idea that order can spontaneously form under various&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;in the natural world.

All of these ideas are explored through the mathematical tool of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape" target="_blank">fitness landscapes</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The book, although long and dense, provides deep insights into the nature of life and evolution. The concepts &nbsp;presented involve&nbsp;mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and biology. I would recommend this book if the reader likes these topics and has enough time (or is fast reader).

<div style="text-align: justify;"><i><a href="//amzn.com/0195121058" target="_blank">Investigations</a>&nbsp;</i>seems to be a further expansion of the ideas presented in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman" target="_blank">Kauffman&#8217;s</a> book <i>Origins of Order </i>(<a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/origins-of-order-stuart-kauffman.html" target="_blank">see other post</a>). As a note, I found that both are very dense and hard to read. However, the concepts presented within are worth the effort. The book provides a novel approach at explaining the origins of life. I found the most fascinating concepts in the novel to be the Adjacent Possible and the idea of Autonomous Agents.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">An Autonomous Agent is simply a system which reproduces itself and carries out a work cycle.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The idea of an Adjacent Possible shines light on the idea of entropy in the universe. <i>Investigations</i>&nbsp;contains an entire section talking about Maxwell&#8217;s Demon and the nonergodicity (see <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis" target="_blank">ergodic hypothesis</a>) of the universe. Briefly, the Adjacent Possible is the set of all &#8220;next&#8221; states of the universe. To give an example, consider the early universe. Consisting almost entirely of Hydrogen and Helium, we would say that the universe was in a &#8220;Actual State&#8221; of Hydrogen and Helium. The Adjacent Possible of chemicals would be the empty set &#8212; that is, no chemical states can be &#8220;formed&#8221; from Hydrogen and Helium (gravity has yet to create stars). &nbsp;Then, once stars began to form, the Adjacent Possible began to include more states; elements like Carbon and Oxygen are the &#8220;next&#8221; states in the interior of stars under the right temperature and pressures. &nbsp;Fast forward billions of years and human organisms are creating &#8220;next&#8221; states in the chemical Adjacent Possible (assuming alien civilizations have not already created these states). For example, humans have created nylon, plastic, Teflon, and various other molecular states. &nbsp;These states would have been considered elements of the Adjacent Possible in the early 20th century; now, they are elements of the &#8220;Actual State&#8221; of the universe.</div>
<p><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/adjacent-possible.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/adjacent-possible.gif" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the universe can be considered nonergodic. It has yet to explore, and most likely will not explore, a large portion of the possible states of the universe.</div>
<p>Kauffman also talks about economics. He explains that modern economic theories fail to predict and account for the&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;innovation of human &#8220;goods&#8221; into the Adjacent Possible of &#8220;goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would highly recommend <i>Investigations. </i>It really is a must read! (ISBN-13: 978-0195121056)</p>

The book demonstrates the wide range of topics that involve complex systems. I feel that the book would be a good reference for further study, as it contains many references.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I was first introduced to the writings of Sole when I found his book entitled&nbsp;<i><a href="//amzn.com/0465019285" target="_blank">Signs of Life</a>. Signs of Life </i>can be considered as a prelude to <i>Phase Transitions.&nbsp;</i>I believe that it was by accident that I found Sole&#8217;s&nbsp;book in the library catalog, or perhaps it was after I had read <i><a href="//amzn.com/0684868768" target="_blank">Emergence The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</a>&nbsp;</i>by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Johnson_%28author%29" target="_blank">Steven Johnson</a>. I feel like Johnson mimicked the outline and ideas of Sole, but that is only my opinion. &nbsp;Sole&#8217;s book provides amazing details on the prevalence of complexity all around us. The book provides a simple and easy to read introduction to the concepts of complexity and serves as a starting point for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman" target="_blank">Kauffman&#8217;s</a> books <i><a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/investigations-stuart-kauffman.html" target="_blank">Investigations </a></i>and <i><a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/origins-of-order-stuart-kauffman.html" target="_blank">Origins of Order</a> </i>(both Sole and Kauffman work/worked at the Santa Fe Institute), which I discuss in other posts.
