				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">UPDATE (2016-Feb-01):</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Upgraded from HD 650 to HD 800. Now in audiophile heaven. Also, added SOtM internal USB port with SOtM SATA In-Line power filter.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I recently switched my computer&#8217;s audio system from the Objective2 Amplifier and ObjectiveDAC (a good low-cost set-up) to the <a href="//www.teac.com/product/ud-501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TEAC USB AUDIO DAC UD-501</a>. I connected the TEAC to a spare laptop running <a href="//www.ap-linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audiophile Linux</a>. Listening with Sennheiser&#8217;s HD 650 headphones, the system playing native <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSD</a> albums sounds remarkable. All instruments and vocals are crystal clear and superbly smooth. It&#8217;s the way music was meant to be heard.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/900x900px-LL-9d60ffd2_DSC_07551.jpeg"><img src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/900x900px-LL-9d60ffd2_DSC_07551.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="212" border="0" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">DSD is the future of music &#8212; beautiful high quality audio. With a well produced DSD album, it sounds as if you are at the recording studio with the artist. Granted that a typical DSD album can be around 2-4 GB, it is rather disappointing that people seem to prefer poor quality MP3 recordings playing on low quality DAC chips in iPods and cell phones. NOTE: If you want a portable option, see the <a href="//dagogo.com/geek-wave-worlds-first-portable-player-capable-32bit-384-khz-native-dsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geek Wave</a>. An MP3 album is less than half the cost of a DSD album, but it is also less than half the quality IMO. I don&#8217;t think many people are aware of how amazing DSD quality music played back with professional quality electronics can sound. Since we live in a time where hard drives in the 2-4 TB range are rather cheap, I hope that consumers begin to demand that music producers focus on providing high fidelity music.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Wishing for a high quality music environment, I did some research into audiophile headphones. I learned that there does not exist a &#8220;best&#8221; pair of headphones. Rather, there are various headphones which are great for their reproduction of various parts of the <a href="//www.teachmeaudio.com/production/mixing/4-techniques/10-audio-spectrum" target="_blank">audio spectrum</a>. For example, the ones that I bought, the <a href="//amzn.com/B0042A8CW2" target="_blank">Sennheiser HD 598s</a> are known to be good (considering their price) for listening to the higher side of the spectrum; i.e., vocals and other high frequency sounds. I must say that I love my Sennheiser HD 598s. <a href="//www.sennheiserusa.com/home" target="_blank">Sennheiser</a> produces a couple of other highly rated headphones, including the <a href="//amzn.com/B00018MSNI" target="_blank">HD 650</a> and <a href="//amzn.com/B001OTZ8DA" target="_blank">HD 800</a>. Here are some other headphones which have good reviews:&nbsp; <a href="//amzn.com/B0006NL5SM" target="_blank">Beyerdynamic DT 770</a>, <a href="//amzn.com/B001RCD2DW" target="_blank">AKG K702</a>, <a href="//amzn.com/B0006DPMU4" target="_blank">Grado SR60</a>, <a href="//amzn.com/B00076VEG6" target="_blank">Grado RS1</a>, and the <a href="//amzn.com/B000ULAP4U" target="_blank">ATH M50</a>. Also, to get the best sound out of the headphones, one should buy an <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/headphone-amp.html" target="_blank">amplifier</a>.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">About a year ago I purchased the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. I have been listening to music with them through my Onkyo TX-SR604. The quality seems decent and I love the sound on the HD 598 (great for vocals and that hi range). However, the potential for a better listening experience has convinced me to try hardware devoted&nbsp;to headphone amplification versus the standard headphone output on the Onkyo. Rather than selling the Onkyo, I will take advantage of its DAC abilities to convert digital signals to&nbsp;analog. Thus, my&nbsp;loss-less&nbsp;FLAC audio collection and the HD audio on YouTube should sound pretty good with an amplifier.</div>
<p>In search of a high quality headphone amplifier I found the following:</p>
<p><b>Qinpu &#8211; A-6000 MKII &#8211; Integrated /Headphone Amplifier</b><br /><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/61Uh3HXl4mL.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/61Uh3HXl4mL.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a><a href="//amzn.com/B0057OI448" target="_blank">Amazon link and reviews</a></p>
<p><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dsc00440.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/dsc00440.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a><b>Matrix M-Stage</b><br /><a href="//amzn.com/B0056ER22E" target="_blank">Amazon link and reviews</a></p>
<p><b></b><br /><b><b><br /></b></b><b><br /></b><b><b><br /></b></b><b>Woo Audio WA3</b><br /><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wooaudio6_def.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wooaudio6_def.jpg" height="145" width="400" /></a><a href="//www.wooaudio.com/products/wa3.html" target="_blank">Official Website of WA3</a></p>
<p><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2b695bb7_430715_3133652501837_1280523376_3309033_491219943_n.jpeg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2b695bb7_430715_3133652501837_1280523376_3309033_491219943_n.jpeg" height="240" width="320" /></a><b>O2&nbsp;</b><br />(the name is like the molecule oxygen)<br /><a href="//www.jdslabs.com/item.php?fetchitem=o2full" target="_blank">JDS Labs &#8211; O2</a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">First, the Qinpu and Woo Audio WA3 are both tube amplifiers. Since I didn&#8217;t know much about amplifiers I thought tubes were cool. However, upon further investigation I found that they may not be the best way to go. Apparently they &#8220;add color&#8221; to the sounds they reproduce. The WA3 is a little pricey ($495 at the date of writing) while the Qinpu is a little better in pricing (around $280). After reading some reviews (<a href="//www.head-fi.org/t/492100/review-woo-audio-3-headphone-amp-da-bomb" target="_blank">head-fi WA3 review</a>)&nbsp;of the WA3 on the Internet and finding a like-new one for sale on Ebay for $350 I was intent on buying it. As my luck died, the WA3 was sold before I made up my mind. Looking at the Qinpu on the Internet I found various reviews. The Amazon reviewers seemed very impressed and happy with there purchase. However, it was at this point that I discovered the Matrix M-Stage.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Matrix M-Stage Amplifier has some great reviews (check Amazon and&nbsp;<a href="//www.head-fi.org/t/475618/matrix-m-stage-amp-review-simple-cheap-and-excellent/3270" target="_blank">head-fi</a>). &nbsp;I was sold on this amplifier. &nbsp;Up until today I was going to buy the M-Stage. But when I looked once more for headphone amplifiers I came across the O2.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The O2 was recommended for the HD 598 headphone on head-fi in one of the forums. After reading that, I looked for more information on the O2. <a href="//nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/07/o2-headphone-amp.html" target="_blank">Here </a>is the webpage of NwAvGuy (the creator of the O2). His webpage also contains a great many other reviews and links for audiophiles. So, I then made my decision to buy this amplifier. The best site I found was&nbsp;<a href="//www.mayflowerelectronics.com/" target="_blank">Mayflower Electronics</a>, which had a holiday special for the standard version of the O2. I bought the O2 for $115.</div>
