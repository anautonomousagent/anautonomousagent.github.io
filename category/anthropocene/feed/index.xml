				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in my middle school class when the teacher turned on the TV. On the news the morning of September 11, 2001 was something I will never forget. Since that time I have never questioned the events on that date. I was unaware of any inconsistencies; being more concerned with upcoming baseball games and playing football in the yard. Perhaps, as an unaware youth, I was simply relying on the honesty and intelligence of the adults in charge of my life and country. My parents were always watching the news. I unconsciously assumed they were aware and knew about any problems in society. Perhaps they, too, were relying on the honesty and intelligence of the media and government. The elected officials in power, voted into office by my parents and countless other citizens, were working hard for the welfare and protection of the American people; why would they harm me or any of my fellow citizens? Didn&#8217;t they swear to protect the American people and uphold the constitution?</p>
<p>Watching the crash of Malaysia Flight MH17 on TV, I had a vague flashback to my memories of 9/11; but the crash I saw in Ukraine looked different. I saw some disturbing pictures which turned my stomach. It actually had bodies and wreckage. But none of the pictures and videos on 9/11 of the two plane crashes away from the towers had any similar images. There were no bodies; no plane engines; no large fuselage pieces. Maybe I was missing something or remembering incorrectly.</p>
<p>I recently had some free time, so I decided to take my mind off the depressing news by laughing at the conspiracy theories concerning 9/11. How could people possibly deny the events which happened that day? So many witnesses, so many affected. I was ready to be amused and shocked by people stretching the evidence, spinning the truth, analyzing fuzzy videos, forming vague connections, and insulting the victims.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t laughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I did feel, after watching <a href="//topdocumentaryfilms.com/september-11-new-pearl-harbor/">September 11: The New Pearl Harbor</a>, was utter disbelief and shock. Perhaps the one I watched was edited and the product of political agenda. In my disbelief, I watched five more videos and did some research. However, the evidence is there. I will not try to convince you, just watch the documentaries with an open mind, free from assumptions. Whatever the truth may be, there are plenty of reasons why there should be another investigation (not done by a government organization) and ALL evidence should be released by the government just like any other criminal case.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_Grace_(TV_series)" target="_blank">All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace</a>, by Adam Curtis, provides a grand overview of many of the people and ideas which have shaped the development of computers, systems, social theory, and politics over the past century. It is one of the better documentaries I have every seen and definitely worth watching; however, I agree with the reviewer John Preston who said it had an &#8220;&#8230;infuriating glibness too as the web of connectedness became ever more stretched. No one could dispute that Curtis has got a very big bite indeed. But what about the chewing, you ask. There wasn’t any – or nothing like enough of it to prevent a bad case of mental indigestion.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems to be entirely possible, and even beneficial, if there was an exchange, analogous to the NYSE, where traders and investors could buy and sell &#8220;shares&#8221; of a species. The exchange would begin by issuing an IPO on every species. For example, ticker symbol: QA could be the &#8220;stock&#8221; for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_alba" target="_blank"><i>Quercus alba</i></a>.</p>
<p>We need to think outside the box to protect our environment and I see this a way to benefit both man and nature. Man will be awarded with more assets with which he can diversify his financial holdings; nature will win in various ways &#8212; including the proceeds of the IPO to protect the species.</p>
<p>This would be initiated to test the idea that a traded asset can be something more general than an organization consisting of human labor and assets.</p>
<p>You may argue that a stock must have a fundamental basis in the value of human commodities and labor. That may be true, however, what limits the definition extending to non-human commodities and the labor of nature? In any case, for the experienced investors, how many companies have you seen being valued in the billions with little or no assets and no profits? In fact, a species actually has an enormous value and potential in terms of biology, ecology, and the sustainability of human activity.</p>
<p>There are numerous possible arguments against this, which I would enjoy countering. Perhaps I will devote more to this in a future post.</p>
