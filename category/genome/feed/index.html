				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to take a bone from a Neanderthal who lived tens of thousands of years ago and extract genetic information about that individual boarders on the unbelievable. Yet, if you read Savnte Pääbo&#8217;s book, <a href="//amzn.com/0465020836" target="_blank">Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes</a>, you will find out how such an achievement was made possible. The book provides a well written account of the journey Pääbo and his team took to ensure that our society would be able to learn about our ancient biological relatives &#8212; the Neanderthal, and more recently, the Denisovan.</p>
<p>My own genome, according to 23andMe has an estimated 2.8% from the Neanderthal genome &#8212; putting me in the 65th percentile. My father has an estimated 3.0%, which puts him in the 87th percentile. Entire DNA composition <a href="//anautonomousagent.com/2014/02/23andme-dna-ancestry/" target="_blank">posted here</a>. Even though I think I will have a low percentage, I hope 23andMe decides to include the Denisovan estimate in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue Armstrong&#8217;s new book, <a href="//amzn.com/1472910516">p53: The Gene that Cracked the Cancer Code</a>, is a fascinating summary of the many people and discoveries which led to our modern knowledge about p53. The book goes into detail about the conceptual struggles and breakthroughs which occurred over a period of several decades. The path to our current understanding was not linear and still continues to be a challenge. The best part about these accounts is the spirit and language with which Armstrong writes. She transforms a subject heavy with biological jargon into a great tale accessible to anyone with a general understanding of biology and genetics.</p>
<p>The book mentions several possible paths for the future of cancer therapy. I think the most interesting are those of prevention and finding a molecular band-aide. The efforts at cancer prevention should really be encouraged and insurance companies should start requiring yearly screenings. If we can achieve rates of discovery around 50-75%, that is solving half the problem. A molecular approach to stabilizing the p53 mutant sounds, to me, like an optimal solution. For an example, see <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695503/">this paper</a>. The discovery of molecules which could safely enter the body and stabilize the mutant p53 &#8212; making it behave normally &#8212; would be a discovery of a lifetime.</p>

<p>I started started reading <i><a href="//amzn.com/0060894083" target="_blank">Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</a></i>, my first time reading anything by <a href="//www.rationaloptimist.com/" target="_blank">Matt Ridley</a>. Ridley knows how to synthesize a great non-fiction novel from dry scientific facts. In this regard, I think he is similar to <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2013/03/carl-zimmer-videos/">Carl Zimmer</a>.</p>
