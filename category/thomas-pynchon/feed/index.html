				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a long time since I read a fictional book. For various uncertain reasons I have only read non-fiction for the past several years; I am tired of non-fiction and for the past few weeks I have been on a quest for a book that grabs me and says: &#8220;Read THIS!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been enjoying Gore Vidal&#8217;s <em>Burr;</em> although a wonderful book of historical fiction, my desire is for a more mind expanding literary challenge. Perhaps Thomas Pynchon&#8217;s work? I am going to start with <em>V</em>.</p>
<p>A fascinating video about Pynchon is linked below; it is amusing to watch how, near the end, the narrators analyze video footage as they search (in vain?) for an image of Pynchon &#8212; it reminded me of the old videos of the ever-elusive big-foot roaming in the woods, too funny.</p>
