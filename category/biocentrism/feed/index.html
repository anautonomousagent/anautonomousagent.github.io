				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Zukav&#8217;s book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dancing_Wu_Li_Masters">The Dancing Wu Li Masters</a>, <em>simply</em> describes (without math) quantum physics and relativity since their inception at the beginning of the 20th century. Zukav skillfully presents the paradoxes and questions posed and asked by some of the smartest people in history including Einstein, Bohr, Born, Heisenberg, von Neumann, Feynman, etc&#8230; He carefully elucidates the evolution of the answers to these paradoxes and questions.</p>
<p>There are numerous analogies with eastern cosmologies which may help readers understand the wild results and conclusions of modern physics. The book is perfect for those without a strong background in the quantitative sciences who wish to understand what quantum physics reveals about the universe. Although dated, (1979) it is inspirational and should get readers excited about reading more up to date books.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0887065414" target="_blank">The Adventure of Self-Discovery</a> by Stanislav Grof is a fascinating book which introduces readers to the inner healing potential of their sub-conscious. The first half of the book builds on themes from <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/realms-of-the-human-unconscious-observations-from-lsd-research-dr-stanislav-grof/" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious</a>. In the second half of the book, Grof explains the rather profound, yet simple, exercise of holotropic breathing. Holotropic breathing allows people access to the ancient tradition of entering non-ordinary states of consciousness without any recourse to the ingestion or smoking of plant material. Please read the entire book if you are interested in performing the breathing without the aid of an experienced holotropic guide. Do not attempt without a sitter.</p>
<p>I put together a music playlist based on Grof&#8217;s recommendations for your benefit. The songs are in random order. Let me know if I should add/remove any:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBs1i4JVDXzQrZTn0walmn8x" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Beginning</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBvSKlFNzRk2TEIW8nKZq12i" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Middle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBsL2-Ln2m1_XmhUYwHYkDun" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; End</a></p>
<p>Also, informative interview with Grof:</p>

<p>I recently finished Robert Lanza&#8217;s book, <a href="//www.robertlanza.com/biocentrism-how-life-and-consciousness-are-the-keys-to-understanding-the-true-nature-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">Biocentrism: How Life and Consciousness are the Keys to Understanding the True Nature of the Universe</a>. While understanding the true nature of the universe is a bold claim, I think there is validity to the perspective of biocentrism based on my own experiences and knowledge. The book kept me thinking and my head spinning. My mind constantly wondered, thinking about the consequences and possible applications of the principles of biocentrism.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lanza’s theory of biocentrism has seven principles (<a href="//www.robertlanzabiocentrism.com/biocentrism/" target="_blank">source</a>):</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our  consciousness. An “external” reality, if it existed, would by definition  have to exist in space. But this is meaningless, because space and time  are not absolute realities but rather tools of the human and animal  mind.</li>
<li>Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined.  They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be divorced from  one another.</li>
<li>The behavior of subatomic particles, indeed all particles and  objects, is inextricably linked to the presence of an observer. Without  the presence of a conscious observer, they at best exist in an  undetermined state of probability waves.</li>
<li>Without consciousness, “matter” dwells in an undetermined state of  probability. Any universe that could have preceded consciousness only  existed in a probability state.</li>
<li>The structure of the universe is explainable only through  biocentrism. The universe is fine-tuned for life, which makes perfect  sense as life creates the universe, not the other way around. The  “universe” is simply the complete spatio-temporal logic of the self.</li>
<li>Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense  perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the  universe.</li>
<li>Space, like time, is not an object or a thing. Space is another form  of our animal understanding and does not have an independent reality.  We carry space and time around with us like turtles with shells. Thus,  there is no absolute self-existing matrix in which physical events occur  independent of life.</li>
</ol>
