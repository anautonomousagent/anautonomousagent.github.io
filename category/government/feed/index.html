				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered <a href="http://a.co/be19wcF">The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard</a>, by David Talbot, and let it collect dust for many months. What a mistake! It must be one of the most eye-opening books about covert power structures in America. Thanks to the writing style and organization, it was hard to put the book down. It should be a must read for any serious student of the time period 1950-1970. In some ways it nicely interweaves with the final chapters of Carroll Quigley&#8217;s <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/10/tragedy-and-hope-carroll-quigley/">Tragedy and Hope</a> which was published in 1964 without knowledge of the many facts publicly released and discovered since Quigley&#8217;s publication. Indeed, consider this: in 1927 Allen Dulles became the 2nd director of the Council on Foreign Relations and from 1933 to 1944 he was the Council&#8217;s secretary. The are too many astounding observations to write them all here. Do yourself a favor and read the book.<br />
Many reviewers claim that <a href="http://a.co/ey4sLkC">JFK and the Unspeakable</a> is a slightly better book regarding the JFK assassination; however, it seems the overall consensus is that The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard is the best book on Allen Welsh Dulles, John Foster Dulles, James Jesus Angleton and the early history of the CIA.</p>

Well, I am certainly not a conspiracy &#8216;<em>theorist&#8217;</em> &#8230; When people take that position I have to laugh&#8230; because I feel sorry for them, they obviously never read a history book. Because anyone who knows anything about history knows that it&#8217;s built on conspiracies &#8212; from one end to the other. Conspiracy is the engine of history! Every major event in history, when you examine it, has come to pass largely as a result of at least one, and in many cases many conspiracies. And it goes on today.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching Chris Hedges&#8217; interview with Sheldon Wolin, I desired to read Wolin&#8217;s books. <em>Democracy Incorporated</em> provided a creative perspective with which to interpret recent American political and social events. Upon completion, I had an urge to continue extracting the political ideas of Wolin and I concluded that the best way to do this would be to jump into the deep end and open his book, <a href="https://amzn.com/0691126275" target="_blank">Politics and Vision</a>. Not only do I now have incredible respect for his ideas but I also feel that he has broadened my personal awareness of my place in society and history. There are criticisms I have toward the content (exclusively focused on &#8220;European/American&#8221;), but they are rather minimal in scope compared to the benefits any reader would gain by reading it thoroughly. I would say that <em>Politics and Vision</em>, as time progresses, will turn out to be one of the most important books I have ever read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Order can exist without a hierarchy, yet I constantly confront the word <em>anarchy</em> in contexts which assume its manipulated definition of disorder. This association degrades the ideas of political anarchists. To remedy this issue, I propose a new word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Autocosmocracy &#8211; a form of society in which the political relations between its members, without the aide of any hierarchical institution, continually gives rise to a self-organized society. A continuously existing society without a higher power structure; a system where authority lies in the absolute freedom of the individual. All members are autonomous agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world of the biologist is filled with organisms which are self-organized. In the natural sciences there are numerous phenomena in which order arises out of agents acting autonomously. Is not man himself a biological creature in the physical world?</p>
<p>Imagine a hypothetical situation where the form of civilization is an autocosmocracy &#8212; all individuals completely autonomous, bound by no institution. I would postulate that inevitably, after a certain number of generations, the civilization would form groups due to scarcity; and that these distinct groups will form their own government. These new groups will throw away the autocosmocratic forms and create novel political frameworks in order to achieve various goals. For instance, there is great dominating strength in having a mass of brutish men who will obey all commands unquestioningly. In other words, in an initial state of complete freedom and liberty, humans will group and band together. It can be shown mathematically that this will be the equilibrium state. Those individuals who fail to join a group will be out competed or destroyed by those who do join a group.</p>
<p>A similar situation occurs in the distributed cryptocurrency mining networks. This system, which is initially distributed with all individual miners acting autonomously, inevitably transforms into a network of groups due to competition and scarcity. So the natural question arises: how to prevent the formation of such groups in the presence of scarcity? Or is it a better question to ask how to eliminate scarcity?</p>
<p>In terms of Plato&#8217;s cave of shadows, it would be a society in which all members are able to discover the source of the shadows. All members would exist as philosopher kings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The imaginary duality of right or left; conservative or liberal; divides the country, providing a distraction while our rights and liberties are quietly subverted. Take the time to hear what Naomi Wolf has to say and you can form your own conclusions. Reminder to scientists: In an oligarchy and/or totalitarian regime, even the scientific method and academic institutions become subjugated to power. Science, in a closed society is worthless except as a tool used by those in power to maintain their power.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The growth of a society into an Empire; how does this occur? is it desirable? if not, how can it be avoided? is it possible to create a set of cultural institutions which makes the probability of this transformation near zero?The study of this transformation is vital for future generations.</p>
<p>Abby Martin has created a series of episodes on YouTube called <a href="http://theempirefiles.tv/" target="_blank">Empire Files</a> which investigates the American Empire. Perhaps with more study we can answer important questions about this emergent cultural phenomenon which is bigger than any one person.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top Documentary Films posts links to numerous free films. It has been one of my favorite places to visit when I am bored; I especially like the coverage of controversial and radical subjects &#8212; films which are unlikely to be found on sites like Netflix and Hulu. One such documentary is <a href="//topdocumentaryfilms.com/counter-intelligence/" target="_blank">Counter Intelligence</a>, an investigation and history of the United States Central Intelligence Agency. Through declassified public documents and former CIA officers, the film reveals how the CIA has operated in the past. Studying the history of the CIA, one can speculate as to how the agency may be influencing current world events.</p>
