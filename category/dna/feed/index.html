<blockquote><p>&#8230; the non-coding sequences have certain statistical features in common with natural and artificial languages. Specifically, we adapt to DNA the Zipf approach to analyzing linguistic texts. These statistical properties of non-coding sequences support the possibility that non-coding regions of DNA may carry biological information.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that quote in mind, consider that Francis Crick <a href="http://ofbacteriaandmen.blogspot.com/2012/08/francis-crick-and-directed-panspermia.html" target="_blank">suggested in 1975</a> that life on Earth could have been the result of &#8220;Directed Panspermia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/cosmic-serpent-dna-and-the-origins-of-knowledge-jeremy-narby/">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge </a>for Jeremy Narbyâ€™s thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p>Messages in DNA? Directed Panspermia? Great ideas for a science fiction movie, yes! But unless scientists find evidence that life definitely arose on Earth through natural processes, then these ideas can and should be considered legitimate hypotheses &#8212; they both can be refuted by evidence showing that they are false.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s entertain the rather wild possibility that the information contained in these non-coding regions may in fact be information encoded in the DNA by an advanced &#8220;thing&#8221; which purposely sent life to Earth. This would suggest the question: &#8220;At what level of development did cells and bacteria arrive on Earth?&#8221; Fully developed with DNA, ribosomes, and protein synthesis? Or, perhaps just DNA contained in a capsule?</p>
<p>If an advanced intelligence wanted to send a message to be received by an organism which eventually developed enough ability to discover this message, how would it do this? What would the message be? What would be the context of the message?</p>
<p>Would it be possible to encode a message as &#8220;form&#8221; in matter. By form, I mean something like studying the processes and relationships of molecular biology, for instance see: <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/the-molecular-basis-of-life/">The Molecular Basis of Life</a>. The incredible form of the DNA transcription; the fascinating ability of the kinesin protein to travel microtubules; could these forms and relationships be the message? If the context is biological travel in space, might these cellular forms and relationships be teaching us how to expand and develop in space?</p>
<p>But a message based on form seems to be invalid because it is the non-coding regions of DNA which are not expressed in protein structures that contain the statistical properties of Zipf. However, I think we still have much to learn about DNA and its interactions with the rest of the cell which may change the way we view DNA. It just seems hard for me to understand how 1,000,000 specially crafted objects (proteins) of various shapes thrown in a zero gravity room together could somehow bounce and collide to eventually create an organized dynamic transport mechanism across that same room &#8212; not to mention the dozens of other cellular processes. So, where does the form of cellular processes arise?</p>
<p>These thoughts came as I was watching 3D animations of kinesin protein travel along microtubules. Perhaps we could design a sort of kinesin vehicle which would travel along a microtubule connection from the Earth to Moon? Or, they could serve as connections between asteroid space bases suspended in the Lagrangian points. No need for rocket fuel, it would be similar to magnetic trains. What would it imply if an idea for space travel and transport could be found inside the cell?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned of Jeremy Narby&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge</a> while reading Graham Hancock&#8217;s book, <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/supernatural-graham-hancock/" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>. The ideas present within both books are incredible. DNA may be an extra-terrestrial biotechnology. Of course, you don&#8217;t have to read these books to come to that conclusion. Narby further suggests that DNA actually has a mysterious way to communicate with the conscious awareness of all life, especially after the consumption of various consciousness altering molecules. It is through this alteration of the brain that life is able to receive a mysterious informational signal from DNA. Even if his hypothesis turns out to be false, the sheer intellectual creativity of Narby&#8217;s work deserves praise. As wild as that sounds, it really would not be surprising given the complexity and probability arguments presented by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" target="_blank">panspermia</a> supporters (Francis Crick for instance and also see: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6739" target="_blank">The &#8220;Wow! signal&#8221; of the terrestrial genetic code</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graham Hancock&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/1932857842" target="_blank">Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind</a> is a great synthesis of various ideas regarding the origin of religion, the visions of shamans, UFO encounters, DMT, elves, fairies and other supernatural phenomenon. I recently read <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/dmt-the-spirit-molecule-rick-strassman-m-d/" target="_blank">Rick Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a> and <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/ayahuasca-medicine-alan-shoemaker/" target="_blank">Alan Shoemaker&#8217;s Ayahuasca Medicine</a>. Thus, I had background knowledge on some of these subjects. This did not prepare me for the incredible connections made by Hancock.</p>
<p>Some of Hancock&#8217;s previous books, like Heavens Mirror, Fingerprints of Gods, Sign and Seal, and Underworld, I read and enjoyed more than seven years ago. I saw Supernatural when it came out in mid 2000&#8217;s, but I was not interested. At the time I thought, &#8220;Clearly Hancock has gone too far into the abyss of crazy.&#8221; It took me more than ten years to mature and discover the greatness of this work. I must say that Hancock does an incredible job and I can not wait to read his newest book, releasing in a few days. Supernatural has the power to shape your perceptions of reality and everything you thought you knew and understood. It is not to be taken lightly and I would suggest first reading Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule and perhaps even <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Jeremy Narby&#8217;s The Cosmic Serpent</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ability to take a bone from a Neanderthal who lived tens of thousands of years ago and extract genetic information about that individual boarders on the unbelievable. Yet, if you read Savnte PÃ¤Ã¤bo&#8217;s book, <a href="//amzn.com/0465020836" target="_blank">Neanderthal Man: In Search of Lost Genomes</a>, you will find out how such an achievement was made possible. The book providesÂ a well written account of the journeyÂ PÃ¤Ã¤bo and his team took to ensure that our society would be able to learn about our ancient biological relatives &#8212; the Neanderthal, and more recently, the Denisovan.</p>
<p>My own genome, according to 23andMe has an estimated 2.8% from the Neanderthal genome &#8212; putting me in the 65th percentile. My father has an estimated 3.0%, which puts him in the 87th percentile. Entire DNA composition <a href="//anautonomousagent.com/2014/02/23andme-dna-ancestry/" target="_blank">posted here</a>. Even though I think I will have a low percentage, I hope 23andMe decides to include the Denisovan estimate in the future.</p>
