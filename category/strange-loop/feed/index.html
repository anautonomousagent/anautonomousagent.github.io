				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/1561840564" target="_blank">Prometheus Rising</a> by Robert Anton Wilson describes the human mind with the eight-circuit model of Leary. Wilson explains how tunnel-realities are formed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And he makes it clear that his book is itself a tunnel-reality written in English to appeal to the third circuit semantic logic of the reader. It is a book to help the reader escape tunnel-realities which is itself a tunnel-reality. That is meta! Meta-programming the reader&#8217;s own mental software to become aware of infinity is the subject of chapter 14. Topics include everything from physics to strange loops to Leary to UFOs to evolution to yoga.</p>
<p>Attempting to elevate the reader&#8217;s awareness to a higher state with verbal or written language is like trying to &#8220;fit a camel through the eye of a needle.&#8221; Hence the studying of Koans by students of Zen, religious fasting to deprive the mind, etc&#8230; Read Alan Watt&#8217;s The Way of Zen for more on that. This book was written by Wilson, who, in his terminology might be a thinker on a higher circuit, trying to communicate to the vast mass of humanity living on the 1st &#8211; 3rd circuits. Once a critical mass of humanity becomes aware, society will under-go a quantum leap in development. With that being said, the book is only an introduction, a starting point for a new perspective to grasp human psychology and human existence as &#8220;domesticated primates&#8221; on Earth. What is left is for the reader to explore the exercises at the end of each chapter and spread the word.</p>
<p>But some may argue that Wilson is himself subject to the same principals he outlines in his book; yes indeed, perhaps the entire book is the ramblings of a man attempting to brainwash his readers into having thoughts of freedom and liberty&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren, Ben, David, and Taylor are four friends who meet on weekends to discuss various ideas and have a good time. They are together one night and begin discussing a business venture.</p>
<p>Warren: I know a great idea! </p>
<p>Ben: Sure, tell us another one of your &#8220;great&#8221; ideas. I hope this one is better than that silly farming device.</p>
<p>David: Alright, let Warren indulge us.</p>
<p>Warren: Ok&#8230; so, what if we printed pieces of paper and told people that they were worth the value of a certain company?</p>
<p>Taylor: Is that your idea? Hahahaha, what could that possibly achieve? I am leaving.</p>
<p>Warren: No, wait! Just think about it. If we printed a fixed number of these papers and said that the sum of the them are worth the value of the company, then we could sell them for that value to people.</p>
<p>Ben: Yes, but what fool would fall for such an obvious scam.</p>
<p>Taylor: What value? How can pieces of paper be worth more than paper? How can we claim that they are worth the value of a certain company?</p>
<p>David: You know, I think Warren has a point. All we have to do is sound reputable and create a way for these pieces of paper to be traded.</p>
<p>Warren: See! David is following me!</p>
<p>David: If this were a scam, we would just sell the papers and run off with the money.</p>
<p>Ben: But isn&#8217;t that your plan?</p>
<p>Warren: Hmm&#8230; True. But in this case, the people are able to trade with each other to get their money back and possibly a profit.</p>
<p>Ben: In fact the potential for a profit would be the only reason for buying these pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Taylor: Hahahah, so this is a giant Ponzi Scheme?</p>
<p>David: Yes, it does seem so, now that you mention it.</p>
<p>Warren: No, there is a difference. We will simply be selling pieces of paper. The &#8220;Ponzi Scheme&#8221; that Taylor mentioned would be caused by the infinite self-repeating pattern of people buying the paper from each other and then selling it to other people for a return.</p>
<p>David: That is a very strange concept. Kinda like a strange loop.</p>
<p>Ben: Ok, but wouldn&#8217;t each person value the pieces of paper differently, based on their opinion on the value of the company?</p>
<p>Taylor: Yes, person Expensive may be willing to pay ten the piece of paper; while person Cheap may only pay ten for the same piece of paper.</p>
<p>David: Then this is idea is doomed. It will never work.</p>
<p>Ben: Too much chaos! </p>
<p>Warren: No! Someone, perhaps seeing an opportunity to profit will establish a definite lower bound to the value of the piece of paper. Let&#8217;s say that lower bound is ten; i.e., there is a person who believes that he can buy a piece of paper for ten and, at a later date, sell it to people for more than ten.</p>
<p>David: Ok. I follow.</p>
<p>Warren: Then, someone else, seeing that there is a potential to make money, will offer 12 for the piece of paper.</p>
<p>Ben: AHH! Yes, a price will dynamically form based on the interactions of all these people.</p>
<p>Taylor: And then?!?!</p>
<p>Warren: Well, then we have a way to sell these pieces of paper for more than the value of paper?</p>
<p>Ben: Yes, precisely.</p>
<p>David: So, by simply saying we have pieces of paper which represent the value of a company we have made a handsome profit?</p>
<p>Warren: Exactly! </p>
<p>Ben: And, in the process we have discovered a way to find the value of a company!</p>
<p>Taylor: Wow! I must say Warren, this is a brilliant idea!</p>
<p>David: What will we do will all this money?</p>
<p>Warren: I think I will buy some of these pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Ben: Me too! And make even more money!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early November I ran across a book called <i><a href="//amzn.com/0465026567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a> </i>by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Douglas Hofstadter</a>.  I began reading that book recently. Every page seems to be a remarkable insight into the universe. Highly recommended as one of the best books I have ever opened. Check out the following music by Bach: <a href="//youtu.be/5-o5lkoI6vE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Musical Offering</a>, <a href="//youtu.be/A41CITk85jk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Never-ending Canon</a>, <a href="//youtu.be/Lrb0dHKJBR4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Die Kunst Der Fuge (The Art of Fugue)</a>, and <a href="//youtu.be/BgFxMnQcLm4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleines harmonisches labyrinth (Little Harmonic Labyrinth)</a>. To complement the book, I purchased the <a href="//amzn.com/B000002ZS9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Art of Fugue</a> by Bach and Tatiana Nikolayeva. The book explains the concept of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godel&#8217;s Incompleteness Theorems</a> and their relationship to cognition. (ISBN-13: 978-0465026562)<br />
Also, check out the work of M.C. Escher: <a href="http://www.mcescher.com/gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallery</a><br />
