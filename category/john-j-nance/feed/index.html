				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was a long term investor in Harold Simmons&#8217; Keystone Consolidated Industries and now I am currently sitting on a nice return from an investment in Valhi. Being a coattail investor in his companies has paid off &#8212; if you can enter at a low price. Some have called him an &#8220;Evil Genius&#8221; and even a crook. However, I find his story to be an amazing story of business success, legal battles, and cunning financial maneuvers to become an icon of the rags-to-riches success story. His biography, written by John J. Nance and entitled <a href="//amzn.com/1571687475" target="_blank">Golden Boy: The Harold Simmons Story</a>, provides a great account of the building of his empire.</p>
