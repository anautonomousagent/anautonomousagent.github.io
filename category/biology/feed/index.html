				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://polymer.bu.edu/hes/articles/bghmmpss95.pdf" target="_blank">Scientists</a>, while studying the <a href="http://www.academia.edu/5447758/Statistical_Properties_of_DNA_Sequences" target="_blank">non-coding regions of DNA</a> found that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; the non-coding sequences have certain statistical features in common with natural and artificial languages. Specifically, we adapt to DNA the Zipf approach to analyzing linguistic texts. These statistical properties of non-coding sequences support the possibility that non-coding regions of DNA may carry biological information.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that quote in mind, consider that Francis Crick <a href="http://ofbacteriaandmen.blogspot.com/2012/08/francis-crick-and-directed-panspermia.html" target="_blank">suggested in 1975</a> that life on Earth could have been the result of &#8220;Directed Panspermia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/cosmic-serpent-dna-and-the-origins-of-knowledge-jeremy-narby/">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge </a>for Jeremy Narbyâ€™s thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p>Messages in DNA? Directed Panspermia? Great ideas for a science fiction movie, yes! But unless scientists find evidence that life definitely arose on Earth through natural processes, then these ideas can and should be considered legitimate hypotheses &#8212; they both can be refuted by evidence showing that they are false.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s entertain the rather wild possibility that the information contained in these non-coding regions may in fact be information encoded in the DNA by an advanced &#8220;thing&#8221; which purposely sent life to Earth. This would suggest the question: &#8220;At what level of development did cells and bacteria arrive on Earth?&#8221; Fully developed with DNA, ribosomes, and protein synthesis? Or, perhaps just DNA contained in a capsule?</p>
<p>If an advanced intelligence wanted to send a message to be received by an organism which eventually developed enough ability to discover this message, how would it do this? What would the message be? What would be the context of the message?</p>
<p>Would it be possible to encode a message as &#8220;form&#8221; in matter. By form, I mean something like studying the processes and relationships of molecular biology, for instance see: <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/the-molecular-basis-of-life/">The Molecular Basis of Life</a>. The incredible form of the DNA transcription; the fascinating ability of the kinesin protein to travel microtubules; could these forms and relationships be the message? If the context is biological travel in space, might these cellular forms and relationships be teaching us how to expand and develop in space?</p>
<p>But a message based on form seems to be invalid because it is the non-coding regions of DNA which are not expressed in protein structures that contain the statistical properties of Zipf. However, I think we still have much to learn about DNA and its interactions with the rest of the cell which may change the way we view DNA. It just seems hard for me to understand how 1,000,000 specially crafted objects (proteins) of various shapes thrown in a zero gravity room together could somehow bounce and collide to eventually create an organized dynamic transport mechanism across that same room &#8212; not to mention the dozens of other cellular processes. So, where does the form of cellular processes arise?</p>
<p>These thoughts came as I was watching 3D animations of kinesin protein travel along microtubules. Perhaps we could design a sort of kinesin vehicle which would travel along a microtubule connection from the Earth to Moon? Or, they could serve as connections between asteroid space bases suspended in the Lagrangian points. No need for rocket fuel, it would be similar to magnetic trains. What would it imply if an idea for space travel and transport could be found inside the cell?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0887065414" target="_blank">The Adventure of Self-Discovery</a> by Stanislav Grof is a fascinating book which introduces readers to the inner healing potential of their sub-conscious. The first half of the book builds on themes from <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/realms-of-the-human-unconscious-observations-from-lsd-research-dr-stanislav-grof/" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious</a>. In the second half of the book, Grof explains the rather profound, yet simple, exercise of holotropic breathing. Holotropic breathing allows people access to the ancient tradition of entering non-ordinary states of consciousness without any recourse to the ingestion or smoking of plant material. Please read the entire book if you are interested in performing the breathing without the aid of an experienced holotropic guide. Do not attempt without a sitter.</p>
<p>I put together a music playlist based on Grof&#8217;s recommendations for your benefit. The songs are in random order. Let me know if I should add/remove any:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBs1i4JVDXzQrZTn0walmn8x" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Beginning</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBvSKlFNzRk2TEIW8nKZq12i" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Middle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBsL2-Ln2m1_XmhUYwHYkDun" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; End</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,Â  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.Â  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned of Jeremy Narby&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge</a> while reading Graham Hancock&#8217;s book, <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/supernatural-graham-hancock/" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>. The ideas present within both books are incredible. DNA may be an extra-terrestrial biotechnology. Of course, you don&#8217;t have to read these books to come to that conclusion. Narby further suggests that DNA actually has a mysterious way to communicate with the conscious awareness of all life, especially after the consumption of various consciousness altering molecules. It is through this alteration of the brain that life is able to receive a mysterious informational signal from DNA. Even if his hypothesis turns out to be false, the sheer intellectual creativity of Narby&#8217;s work deserves praise. As wild as that sounds, it really would not be surprising given the complexity and probability arguments presented by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" target="_blank">panspermia</a> supporters (Francis Crick for instance and also see: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6739" target="_blank">The &#8220;Wow! signal&#8221; of the terrestrial genetic code</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terence McKenna&#8217;s experiences with the DMT molecule piqued my already curious mind. Talking with Elves? Hyperspace travel and other dimensions? Mystical visions? Was McKenna a deranged urban shaman luring others into the world of psychedelia? I decided to investigate by first reading a book. This was Rick Strassman&#8217;s, <a href="http://amzn.com/0892819278" target="_blank">DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a>. It is based on Strassman&#8217;s own research with human subjects on the effects of the DMT molecule from 1990 &#8211; 1995.</p>
<p>After finishing the book, I had a strong intuitive sense that McKenna was correct. Travelling to other dimensions, having a mystical experience, and talking to other beings are hallmarks of a DMT trip. The DMT molecule is a sort of high octane fuel for the brain which allows a higher level of conscious reality. Perhaps even accessing new forces and energies unknown to current science. Think of the 1820&#8217;s and 1830&#8217;s and the eventual realization during that period that the world is saturated with electromagnetic forces and fields. Then scientists found that the actual functioning of their brain relies on these forces which were previously unknown. Physics helped lead to discoveries in biology. Perhaps this time, the flow of discovery will be reversed &#8212; from biology to physics.</p>
<p>If DMT is the fuel, then the brain is the motor, the engine for visiting and travelling to indescribable places. In many ways the human body is the most sophisticated piece of technology which exists on this planet. It&#8217;s no wonder that many call it a temple. Perhaps it&#8217;s this natural technology which will enable humans to discover how to really travel to the stars. Or perhaps with better understanding of the DMT molecule we will more fully understand what it means to live and exist as a conscious being.</p>
<p>Brain biotechnology, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland" target="_blank">pineal gland</a>, may hold the key to understanding the holographic universe of Bohm. He was interested in which part of the brain played the role of accessing the holographic universe. Might the primary instrument be the pineal gland?</p>
<p>I was surprised to find, after reading many books on evolution, that no one really mentions the fact that our ancient common ancestors in the ocean, and eventually on land, had three eyes. The pineal gland, according to evolutionary biologists is today&#8217;s analogue to this ancient third sense organ. Indeed, many species today have what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">Parietal eye</a>. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">Tuatara</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">Triops</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye#Anatomy" target="_blank">extinct species as well</a>. This is a functioning organ in the human brain (technically not part of the brain &#8212; it forms from cells on the roof of the mouth) which has roots as a sense organ. Is it &#8220;sensing&#8221; today? Why has evolution migrated the organ to the center of the brain with immediate access to our nervous system? And what might be its function asÂ  <a href="https://taobabe.wordpress.com/the-body-piezo-electric/" target="_blank">piezoelectric device</a>?</p>
<p>I would highly suggest reading Strassman&#8217;s book to enjoy the amazing experiences the volunteers described (as best they could). Even reading their experiences gave me chills and a sense of healing. This is a fascinating area of research and perhaps a new age of human existence will be born from it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading books which made numerous references to the ideas of Vladimir Vernadsky, I decided to read his book, <a href="//amzn.com/038798268X">The Biosphere</a>. It is an insightful and important book whichÂ provides numerous novel insights into the interconnected nature of the entire biosphere &#8212; theÂ biogeochemical and thermodynamic relationships between living and non-living matter. The 1998 publication with Editor M.A.S McMenamin contains hundreds of great footnotes and further references. I also enjoyed the informative introduction by Jacques Grinevald.</p>
<p>Vernadsky&#8217;s &#8220;Pressure of Life&#8221; concept isÂ new to me and struck me as important. It should, theoretically, be a measurable pressure. Just as we can measure Pascals or Newtons of pressure, the same should be the case for life&#8217;s pressure. There is only the issueÂ of determining the system&#8217;s extent and defining the measurable quantity. For example, the entire biosphere must exert a given pressure againstÂ the Earth&#8217;s geochemical resources given a flux of cosmic solar energy. The biosphere &#8220;wants&#8221; and &#8220;tries&#8221; to multiply and thus expand against the finite constraint of resources available to the current state of biospheric evolution. Copying Vernadsky&#8217;s own analogy of a farmer clearing land, the freshly cleared land has been removed of the majority of its life above the soil. Thus there exists a pressure to fill thisÂ &#8220;vacuum&#8221; of life. How can we measure this pressure?</p>
<p>This brings to mindÂ the related ideas of the logistic function and the oscillations which occur due to population expansion against finite resources. Life seems to typically overshoot the carrying capacity Â due to rapid initial multiplication. Only to later collapse and once again overshoot in a series of oscillations. Once the cleared land has been mostly filled, this pressure changes and occurs both inter- and intra- species.
