				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me provide a context so that you may understand my amazement with the chemical explorations of Alexander Shulgin. Did you know that the two principal neurotransmitters in the human body are dopamine and serotonin? Did you know that they belong to the phenethylamine and tryptamine chemical families, respectively? I find this simple observation to be of fundamental importance in understanding the human mind/body relationship. And now consider that Ann and Alex Shulgins&#8217; books: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL">PiKHAL</a> (Phenethylamines I have known and loved) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiHKAL">TiKHAL</a> (Tryptamines I have known and loved) explore both these chemical families and their effects on the human mind and body. Quick summary of well-known psychedelic chemicals:</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Phenethylamines</th>
<th>Tryptamines</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">Dopamine</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin">Serotonin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline">Mescaline</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine">MDA</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin">Psilocybin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA">MDMA</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocin">Psilocin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C_(psychedelics)">2C Family</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine">Ibogaine</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a>?</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>LSD is complex and has both chemical structures, but most people emphasizes that the effects of LSD are related primarily to its tryptamine backbone and interaction with human serotonin receptors.</p>
<p>Ann and Alexander Shulgin&#8217;s books are a groundbreaking revelation for their accounts of psychedelic exploration, therapy, and spiritual development. They are a mix of essays and stories. You will not regret reading the books and learning about the chemicals referenced in the second half of the books.</p>
<p>An interesting note: In PiKHAL, the fictional character Adam Fisher is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Zeff">Leo Zeff</a>, a talented psychotherapist who worked with MDMA; you can read all about his therapy work in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2750163-the-secret-chief-revealed">The Secret Chief Revealed</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Stolaroff">Myron J. Stolaroff</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid, I remember being confused as to why adults would drink beer and alcohol. The terrible taste was clearly the body&#8217;s survival mechanism telling yourself to avoid the poison. And it made people act strange. So why did they drink it? Once I entered college, I soon discovered why this foul beverage was so popular. Moderation and measure is the key to alcohol. Interestingly, I find myself in the same situation, learning of another, even more notoriously nasty beverage: Ayahuasca. Except in this case, the beverage is known as the ultimate medicine. The fascinating tales of the spirit world associated with this beverage make it an extreme curiosity.  I read Alan Shoemaker&#8217;s book, <a href="http://amzn.com/1620551934" target="_blank">Ayahuasca Medicine</a> with a deep interest and open mind about the shamanic traditions of the Amazon curanderos (I also just learned of the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150721134827.htm" target="_blank">genetic connection between some Amazon tribes and the Aborigines</a>). Shoemaker has a remarkable tale to tell to the world and we should listen carefully.</p>

This was Rick Strassman&#8217;s, <a href="http://amzn.com/0892819278" target="_blank">DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a>. It is based on Strassman&#8217;s own research with human subjects on the effects of the DMT molecule from 1990 &#8211; 1995.</p>
<p>After finishing the book, I had a strong intuitive sense that McKenna was correct. Travelling to other dimensions, having a mystical experience, and talking to other beings are hallmarks of a DMT trip. The DMT molecule is a sort of high octane fuel for the brain which allows a higher level of conscious reality. Perhaps even accessing new forces and energies unknown to current science. Think of the 1820&#8217;s and 1830&#8217;s and the eventual realization during that period that the world is saturated with electromagnetic forces and fields. Then scientists found that the actual functioning of their brain relies on these forces which were previously unknown. Physics helped lead to discoveries in biology. Perhaps this time, the flow of discovery will be reversed &#8212; from biology to physics.</p>
<p>If DMT is the fuel, then the brain is the motor, the engine for visiting and travelling to indescribable places. In many ways the human body is the most sophisticated piece of technology which exists on this planet. It&#8217;s no wonder that many call it a temple. Perhaps it&#8217;s this natural technology which will enable humans to discover how to really travel to the stars. Or perhaps with better understanding of the DMT molecule we will more fully understand what it means to live and exist as a conscious being.</p>
<p>Brain biotechnology, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland" target="_blank">pineal gland</a>, may hold the key to understanding the holographic universe of Bohm. He was interested in which part of the brain played the role of accessing the holographic universe. Might the primary instrument be the pineal gland?</p>
<p>I was surprised to find, after reading many books on evolution, that no one really mentions the fact that our ancient common ancestors in the ocean, and eventually on land, had three eyes. The pineal gland, according to evolutionary biologists is today&#8217;s analogue to this ancient third sense organ. Indeed, many species today have what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">Parietal eye</a>. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">Tuatara</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">Triops</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye#Anatomy" target="_blank">extinct species as well</a>. This is a functioning organ in the human brain (technically not part of the brain &#8212; it forms from cells on the roof of the mouth) which has roots as a sense organ. Is it &#8220;sensing&#8221; today? Why has evolution migrated the organ to the center of the brain with immediate access to our nervous system? And what might be its function as  <a href="https://taobabe.wordpress.com/the-body-piezo-electric/" target="_blank">piezoelectric device</a>?</p>
<p>I would highly suggest reading Strassman&#8217;s book to enjoy the amazing experiences the volunteers described (as best they could). Even reading their experiences gave me chills and a sense of healing. This is a fascinating area of research and perhaps a new age of human existence will be born from it.</p>
