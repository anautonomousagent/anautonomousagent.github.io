				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">About a year ago I purchased the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. I have been listening to music with them through my Onkyo TX-SR604. The quality seems decent and I love the sound on the HD 598 (great for vocals and that hi range). However, the potential for a better listening experience has convinced me to try hardware devoted&nbsp;to headphone amplification versus the standard headphone output on the Onkyo. Rather than selling the Onkyo, I will take advantage of its DAC abilities to convert digital signals to&nbsp;analog. Thus, my&nbsp;loss-less&nbsp;FLAC audio collection and the HD audio on YouTube should sound pretty good with an amplifier.</div>
<p>In search of a high quality headphone amplifier I found the following:</p>
<p><b>Qinpu &#8211; A-6000 MKII &#8211; Integrated /Headphone Amplifier</b><br /><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/61Uh3HXl4mL.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/61Uh3HXl4mL.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a><a href="//amzn.com/B0057OI448" target="_blank">Amazon link and reviews</a></p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">First, the Qinpu and Woo Audio WA3 are both tube amplifiers. Since I didn&#8217;t know much about amplifiers I thought tubes were cool. However, upon further investigation I found that they may not be the best way to go. Apparently they &#8220;add color&#8221; to the sounds they reproduce. The WA3 is a little pricey ($495 at the date of writing) while the Qinpu is a little better in pricing (around $280). After reading some reviews (<a href="//www.head-fi.org/t/492100/review-woo-audio-3-headphone-amp-da-bomb" target="_blank">head-fi WA3 review</a>)&nbsp;of the WA3 on the Internet and finding a like-new one for sale on Ebay for $350 I was intent on buying it. As my luck died, the WA3 was sold before I made up my mind. Looking at the Qinpu on the Internet I found various reviews. The Amazon reviewers seemed very impressed and happy with there purchase. However, it was at this point that I discovered the Matrix M-Stage.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Matrix M-Stage Amplifier has some great reviews (check Amazon and&nbsp;<a href="//www.head-fi.org/t/475618/matrix-m-stage-amp-review-simple-cheap-and-excellent/3270" target="_blank">head-fi</a>). &nbsp;I was sold on this amplifier. &nbsp;Up until today I was going to buy the M-Stage. But when I looked once more for headphone amplifiers I came across the O2.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The O2 was recommended for the HD 598 headphone on head-fi in one of the forums. After reading that, I looked for more information on the O2. <a href="//nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/07/o2-headphone-amp.html" target="_blank">Here </a>is the webpage of NwAvGuy (the creator of the O2). His webpage also contains a great many other reviews and links for audiophiles. So, I then made my decision to buy this amplifier. The best site I found was&nbsp;<a href="//www.mayflowerelectronics.com/" target="_blank">Mayflower Electronics</a>, which had a holiday special for the standard version of the O2. I bought the O2 for $115.</div>
