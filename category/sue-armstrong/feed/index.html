				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sue Armstrong&#8217;s new book, <a href="//amzn.com/1472910516">p53: The Gene that Cracked the Cancer Code</a>, is a fascinating summary of the many people and discoveries which led to our modern knowledge about p53. The book goes into detail about the conceptual struggles and breakthroughs which occurred over a period of several decades. The path to our current understanding was not linear and still continues to be a challenge. The best part about these accounts is the spirit and language with which Armstrong writes. She transforms a subject heavy with biological jargon into a great tale accessible to anyone with a general understanding of biology and genetics.</p>
<p>The book mentions several possible paths for the future of cancer therapy. I think the most interesting are those of prevention and finding a molecular band-aide. The efforts at cancer prevention should really be encouraged and insurance companies should start requiring yearly screenings. If we can achieve rates of discovery around 50-75%, that is solving half the problem. A molecular approach to stabilizing the p53 mutant sounds, to me, like an optimal solution. For an example, see <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695503/">this paper</a>. The discovery of molecules which could safely enter the body and stabilize the mutant p53 &#8212; making it behave normally &#8212; would be a discovery of a lifetime.</p>
