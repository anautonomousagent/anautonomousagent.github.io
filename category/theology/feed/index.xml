								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0887065414" target="_blank">The Adventure of Self-Discovery</a> by Stanislav Grof is a fascinating book which introduces readers to the inner healing potential of their sub-conscious. The first half of the book builds on themes from <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/realms-of-the-human-unconscious-observations-from-lsd-research-dr-stanislav-grof/" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious</a>. In the second half of the book, Grof explains the rather profound, yet simple, exercise of holotropic breathing. Holotropic breathing allows people access to the ancient tradition of entering non-ordinary states of consciousness without any recourse to the ingestion or smoking of plant material. Please read the entire book if you are interested in performing the breathing without the aid of an experienced holotropic guide. Do not attempt without a sitter.</p>
<p>I put together a music playlist based on Grof&#8217;s recommendations for your benefit. The songs are in random order. Let me know if I should add/remove any:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBs1i4JVDXzQrZTn0walmn8x" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Beginning</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBvSKlFNzRk2TEIW8nKZq12i" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Middle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBsL2-Ln2m1_XmhUYwHYkDun" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; End</a></p>
<p>Also, informative interview with Grof:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graham Hancock&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/1932857842" target="_blank">Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind</a> is a great synthesis of various ideas regarding the origin of religion, the visions of shamans, UFO encounters, DMT, elves, fairies and other supernatural phenomenon. I recently read <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/dmt-the-spirit-molecule-rick-strassman-m-d/" target="_blank">Rick Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a> and <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/ayahuasca-medicine-alan-shoemaker/" target="_blank">Alan Shoemaker&#8217;s Ayahuasca Medicine</a>. Thus, I had background knowledge on some of these subjects. This did not prepare me for the incredible connections made by Hancock.</p>
<p>Some of Hancock&#8217;s previous books, like Heavens Mirror, Fingerprints of Gods, Sign and Seal, and Underworld, I read and enjoyed more than seven years ago. I saw Supernatural when it came out in mid 2000&#8217;s, but I was not interested. At the time I thought, &#8220;Clearly Hancock has gone too far into the abyss of crazy.&#8221; It took me more than ten years to mature and discover the greatness of this work. I must say that Hancock does an incredible job and I can not wait to read his newest book, releasing in a few days. Supernatural has the power to shape your perceptions of reality and everything you thought you knew and understood. It is not to be taken lightly and I would suggest first reading Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule and perhaps even <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Jeremy Narby&#8217;s The Cosmic Serpent</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/1561840564" target="_blank">Prometheus Rising</a> by Robert Anton Wilson describes the human mind with the eight-circuit model of Leary. Wilson explains how tunnel-realities are formed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And he makes it clear that his book is itself a tunnel-reality written in English to appeal to the third circuit semantic logic of the reader. It is a book to help the reader escape tunnel-realities which is itself a tunnel-reality. That is meta! Meta-programming the reader&#8217;s own mental software to become aware of infinity is the subject of chapter 14. Topics include everything from physics to strange loops to Leary to UFOs to evolution to yoga.</p>
<p>Attempting to elevate the reader&#8217;s awareness to a higher state with verbal or written language is like trying to &#8220;fit a camel through the eye of a needle.&#8221; Hence the studying of Koans by students of Zen, religious fasting to deprive the mind, etc&#8230; Read Alan Watt&#8217;s The Way of Zen for more on that. This book was written by Wilson, who, in his terminology might be a thinker on a higher circuit, trying to communicate to the vast mass of humanity living on the 1st &#8211; 3rd circuits. Once a critical mass of humanity becomes aware, society will under-go a quantum leap in development. With that being said, the book is only an introduction, a starting point for a new perspective to grasp human psychology and human existence as &#8220;domesticated primates&#8221; on Earth. What is left is for the reader to explore the exercises at the end of each chapter and spread the word.</p>
<p>But some may argue that Wilson is himself subject to the same principals he outlines in his book; yes indeed, perhaps the entire book is the ramblings of a man attempting to brainwash his readers into having thoughts of freedom and liberty&#8230;</p>
