				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://amzn.com/094500110X">Tragedy and Hope</a></em> by Carroll Quigley narrates and analyzes world history from the late 1800&#8217;s to 1964. Throughout Quigley&#8217;s narration he mentions details of individual people who welded enormous power and influence over events; it would be naive to suggest that they were &#8220;all powerful&#8221; &#8211; some of the time they successfully shaped history while at other times they failed. It is simply the nature of the hierarchical system of organization of society which encourages and allows such influence.</p>
<p>I would agree with <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/07/the-quigley-formula-g-edward-griffin-lecture/">G. Edward Griffin</a> that conspiracy is an important force in the formation of history and is critical to understanding <em>why </em>events progress in various ways. However, we must be careful with attributing full power of determination to such forces. We should qualify with Bismarck&#8217;s comment that: &#8220;The statesman&#8217;s task is to hear God&#8217;s footsteps marching through history, and to try and catch on to His coattails as He marches past.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is humorous that most people on the far right recommend Quigley when he mentions several times in the book that he despises them and their motives. For instance on page 1244:</p>
<blockquote><p>The second most numerous group in the United States is the petty bourgeoisie, including millions of persons who regard themselves as middle class and are under all the middle-class anxieties and pressures, but often earn less money than unionized laborers. As a results of these things, they are often very insecure, envious, filled with hatreds, and are generally the chief recruits for any Radical Right, Fascist, or hate campaigns against any group that is different or which refuses to conform to middle-class values. &#8230; They form the major portion of the Republican Party&#8217;s supporters in the towns of America, as they did for the Nazis in Germany&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This attitude is reflected in various forms throughout the book. On the other hand, Quigley greatly supports conservatism of an interesting type; on page 1232 he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; we might say that the whole recent controversy between conservatism and liberalism is utterly wrongheaded and ignorant. Since the true role of conservatism must be to conserve the tradition of our society, and since that tradition is a liberal tradition, the two should be closely allied in their aim at common goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>He reflects on the underlying power relationships and how they function when he continues: &#8220;So long as liberals and conservatives have as their primary goals to defend interests and to belabor each other for partisan reasons, they cannot do this.&#8221; The traditions of society cannot be conserved because the power held by special interests opposes unification.</p>
<p>Far right people are the first to tell you about grand conspiracies like the Trilateral Commission or the Round Table groups as mentioned by Quigley. In fact, it was from a clip of Alex Jones that I learned about Quigley&#8217;s book. In my own experience both the far right and far left maintain ridiculous and unrealistic outlooks and understandings of power.</p>
<p>The Western Tradition, which Quigley mentions extensively, exists in his mind, if not in the real world, as a basis for all the progress and success of the people who self-identify as &#8220;Western.&#8221; He states on page 1229 that Western Traditions consist of six core fundamental ideologies:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a truth, a reality.</li>
<li>No person, group, or organization has the whole picture of the truth.</li>
<li>Every person of goodwill has some aspect of the truth, some vision of it from the angle of his own experience.</li>
<li>Through discussion, the aspects of the truth held by many can be pooled and arranged to form a consensus closer to the truth than any of the sources that contributed to it.</li>
<li>This consensus is a temporary approximation of the truth, which is no sooner made than new experiences and additional information make it possible for it to be reformulated in a <em>closer</em> approximation of the truth by continued discussion.</li>
<li>Thus Western man&#8217;s picture of the truth advances, by successive approximations, closer and closer to the whole truth without ever reaching it.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, Quigley is no idealist, and his thoughts help to provide a realistic understanding of the nature of power in the hierarchies which control and function on various levels in nation-states. And he does this through a narration and analysis of &#8220;history in our time.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/069114589X" target="_blank">Democracy Incorporated</a>, Sheldon Wolin analyzes the current (2010 preface) American polity and its historical development. Every line is eye opening and revelatory, especially for those Americans who have been living in a virtual-reality cave for the past 15 years and/or have not been able to find the leisure time to discover what is slowly happening to their beloved society. The already aware reader will immediately identify with Wolin&#8217;s perspective and understand his point &#8212; that the government can be considered a corporate government. He makes it clear that despite calling their government a <em>democracy</em>, the American people live in a &#8220;managed democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a path to legitimate democracy is to be successful, the people themselves must begin the renewal process by creating a democratic ethos in every individual &#8212; the revolution must come from within each citizen. Change will not come from the elites who promise change!</p>
<p>Wolin is poignantly critical of certain groups of political elites who insist, unwaveringly, that the founding fathers and the Constitution are outside the sphere of critique. These foundations for American &#8220;managed democracy&#8221; are treated as if they were created and inspired by divinity. Of course, Wolin does not suggest that the foundations should be abolished. They should be improved, clarified, and refined as required by developments in technology and culture. He points out the hypocrisy in the rhetoric of politicians &#8212; that they simultaneously deify and nullify the Constitution. At every opportunity, politicians and government officials attempt to subvert the powers they swore to protect.</p>
<p>Wolin&#8217;s book is a must read for any democratically inclined citizen and every American!</p>
<p>The following is one of the only video interviews of Wolin I could find:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The imaginary duality of right or left; conservative or liberal; divides the country, providing a distraction while our rights and liberties are quietly subverted. Take the time to hear what Naomi Wolf has to say and you can form your own conclusions. Reminder to scientists: In an oligarchy and/or totalitarian regime, even the scientific method and academic institutions become subjugated to power. Science, in a closed society is worthless except as a tool used by those in power to maintain their power.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The growth of a society into an Empire; how does this occur? is it desirable? if not, how can it be avoided? is it possible to create a set of cultural institutions which makes the probability of this transformation near zero?The study of this transformation is vital for future generations.</p>
<p>Abby Martin has created a series of episodes on YouTube called <a href="http://theempirefiles.tv/" target="_blank">Empire Files</a> which investigates the American Empire. Perhaps with more study we can answer important questions about this emergent cultural phenomenon which is bigger than any one person.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="//amzn.com/1888363827" target="_blank">Profit Over People: Neoliberalism &amp; Global Order</a>,&nbsp;Noam Chomsky critiques the economic vogue held by a large number of economists and government officials during the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing to this day. In truth, it seems as if many of our climate and social problems stem from the concerns raised by Chomsky. If we as a species wish to continue living in a global community on Earth &#8212; enjoying the benefits of mutual aid and global economic prosperity to achieve a greater civilization, it seems that it is necessary to address the issues presented by Chomsky. Of course, working towards such an ideal society and generating such sublime goals is always optional. The foundation upon which rests all great civilizations is the confidence and power of its people to see and seize their own destiny. Read the book and you may begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watch it: <a href="//youtu.be/2bFOhAAYfqk" target="_blank">The Trials of Henry Kissinger (2002) </a></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Part contemporary investigation and part historical inquiry, documentary  follows the quest of one journalist in search of justice. The film  focuses on Christopher Hitchens&#8217; charges against Henry Kissinger as a  war criminal &#8211; allegations documented in <a href="//amzn.com/145552297X" target="_blank">Hitchens&#8217; book </a>of the same  title &#8211; based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and  Indonesia. Kissinger&#8217;s story raises profound questions about American  foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing  evidence about one man&#8217;s role in a long history of human rights abuses  leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens  of international standards of justice.                <em>Written by <a href="//www.imdb.com/search/title?plot_author=Sujit%20R.%20Varma&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha">Sujit R. Varma</a></em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in my middle school class when the teacher turned on the TV. On the news the morning of September 11, 2001 was something I will never forget. Since that time I have never questioned the events on that date. I was unaware of any inconsistencies; being more concerned with upcoming baseball games and playing football in the yard. Perhaps, as an unaware youth, I was simply relying on the honesty and intelligence of the adults in charge of my life and country. My parents were always watching the news. I unconsciously assumed they were aware and knew about any problems in society. Perhaps they, too, were relying on the honesty and intelligence of the media and government. The elected officials in power, voted into office by my parents and countless other citizens, were working hard for the welfare and protection of the American people; why would they harm me or any of my fellow citizens? Didn&#8217;t they swear to protect the American people and uphold the constitution?</p>
<p>Watching the crash of Malaysia Flight MH17 on TV, I had a vague flashback to my memories of 9/11; but the crash I saw in Ukraine looked different. I saw some disturbing pictures which turned my stomach. It actually had bodies and wreckage. But none of the pictures and videos on 9/11 of the two plane crashes away from the towers had any similar images. There were no bodies; no plane engines; no large fuselage pieces. Maybe I was missing something or remembering incorrectly.</p>
<p>I recently had some free time, so I decided to take my mind off the depressing news by laughing at the conspiracy theories concerning 9/11. How could people possibly deny the events which happened that day? So many witnesses, so many affected. I was ready to be amused and shocked by people stretching the evidence, spinning the truth, analyzing fuzzy videos, forming vague connections, and insulting the victims.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t laughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I did feel, after watching <a href="//topdocumentaryfilms.com/september-11-new-pearl-harbor/">September 11: The New Pearl Harbor</a>, was utter disbelief and shock. Perhaps the one I watched was edited and the product of political agenda. In my disbelief, I watched five more videos and did some research. However, the evidence is there. I will not try to convince you, just watch the documentaries with an open mind, free from assumptions. Whatever the truth may be, there are plenty of reasons why there should be another investigation (not done by a government organization) and ALL evidence should be released by the government just like any other criminal case.</p>
