				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered <a href="http://a.co/be19wcF">The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard</a>, by David Talbot, and let it collect dust for many months. What a mistake! It must be one of the most eye-opening books about covert power structures in America. Thanks to the writing style and organization, it was hard to put the book down. It should be a must read for any serious student of the time period 1950-1970. In some ways it nicely interweaves with the final chapters of Carroll Quigley&#8217;s <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/10/tragedy-and-hope-carroll-quigley/">Tragedy and Hope</a> which was published in 1964 without knowledge of the many facts publicly released and discovered since Quigley&#8217;s publication. Indeed, consider this: in 1927 Allen Dulles became the 2nd director of the Council on Foreign Relations and from 1933 to 1944 he was the Council&#8217;s secretary. The are too many astounding observations to write them all here. Do yourself a favor and read the book.<br />
Many reviewers claim that <a href="http://a.co/ey4sLkC">JFK and the Unspeakable</a> is a slightly better book regarding the JFK assassination; however, it seems the overall consensus is that The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard is the best book on Allen Welsh Dulles, John Foster Dulles, James Jesus Angleton and the early history of the CIA.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching Chris Hedges&#8217; interview with Sheldon Wolin, I desired to read Wolin&#8217;s books. <em>Democracy Incorporated</em> provided a creative perspective with which to interpret recent American political and social events. Upon completion, I had an urge to continue extracting the political ideas of Wolin and I concluded that the best way to do this would be to jump into the deep end and open his book, <a href="https://amzn.com/0691126275" target="_blank">Politics and Vision</a>. Not only do I now have incredible respect for his ideas but I also feel that he has broadened my personal awareness of my place in society and history. There are criticisms I have toward the content (exclusively focused on &#8220;European/American&#8221;), but they are rather minimal in scope compared to the benefits any reader would gain by reading it thoroughly. I would say that <em>Politics and Vision</em>, as time progresses, will turn out to be one of the most important books I have ever read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Order can exist without a hierarchy, yet I constantly confront the word <em>anarchy</em> in contexts which assume its manipulated definition of disorder. This association degrades the ideas of political anarchists. To remedy this issue, I propose a new word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Autocosmocracy &#8211; a form of society in which the political relations between its members, without the aide of any hierarchical institution, continually gives rise to a self-organized society. A continuously existing society without a higher power structure; a system where authority lies in the absolute freedom of the individual. All members are autonomous agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world of the biologist is filled with organisms which are self-organized. In the natural sciences there are numerous phenomena in which order arises out of agents acting autonomously. Is not man himself a biological creature in the physical world?</p>
<p>Imagine a hypothetical situation where the form of civilization is an autocosmocracy &#8212; all individuals completely autonomous, bound by no institution. I would postulate that inevitably, after a certain number of generations, the civilization would form groups due to scarcity; and that these distinct groups will form their own government. These new groups will throw away the autocosmocratic forms and create novel political frameworks in order to achieve various goals. For instance, there is great dominating strength in having a mass of brutish men who will obey all commands unquestioningly. In other words, in an initial state of complete freedom and liberty, humans will group and band together. It can be shown mathematically that this will be the equilibrium state. Those individuals who fail to join a group will be out competed or destroyed by those who do join a group.</p>
<p>A similar situation occurs in the distributed cryptocurrency mining networks. This system, which is initially distributed with all individual miners acting autonomously, inevitably transforms into a network of groups due to competition and scarcity. So the natural question arises: how to prevent the formation of such groups in the presence of scarcity? Or is it a better question to ask how to eliminate scarcity?</p>
<p>In terms of Plato&#8217;s cave of shadows, it would be a society in which all members are able to discover the source of the shadows. All members would exist as philosopher kings.</p>

<p><a href="https://followmyvote.com/" target="_blank">Follow My Vote</a> is a revolutionary new platform which utilizes blockchain technology to allow voters to vote at home and on their own time. The blockchain has enormous potential for many applications, especially voting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another application for blockchain technology is voting. By casting votes as transactions, we can create a blockchain which keeps track of the tallies of the votes. This way, everyone can agree on the final count because they can count the votes themselves, and because of the blockchain audit trail, they can verify that no votes were changed or removed, and no illegitimate votes were added.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/069114589X" target="_blank">Democracy Incorporated</a>, Sheldon Wolin analyzes the current (2010 preface) American polity and its historical development. Every line is eye opening and revelatory, especially for those Americans who have been living in a virtual-reality cave for the past 15 years and/or have not been able to find the leisure time to discover what is slowly happening to their beloved society. The already aware reader will immediately identify with Wolin&#8217;s perspective and understand his point &#8212; that the government can be considered a corporate government. He makes it clear that despite calling their government a <em>democracy</em>, the American people live in a &#8220;managed democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a path to legitimate democracy is to be successful, the people themselves must begin the renewal process by creating a democratic ethos in every individual &#8212; the revolution must come from within each citizen. Change will not come from the elites who promise change!</p>
<p>Wolin is poignantly critical of certain groups of political elites who insist, unwaveringly, that the founding fathers and the Constitution are outside the sphere of critique. These foundations for American &#8220;managed democracy&#8221; are treated as if they were created and inspired by divinity. Of course, Wolin does not suggest that the foundations should be abolished. They should be improved, clarified, and refined as required by developments in technology and culture. He points out the hypocrisy in the rhetoric of politicians &#8212; that they simultaneously deify and nullify the Constitution. At every opportunity, politicians and government officials attempt to subvert the powers they swore to protect.</p>
<p>Wolin&#8217;s book is a must read for any democratically inclined citizen and every American!</p>
<p>The following is one of the only video interviews of Wolin I could find:</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">A sobering critique of modern history, Noam Chomsky&#8217;s <a href="//amzn.com/1931859965" target="_blank">Hopes and Prospects</a> shows just how easily the mind can be mislead. Human behavior tends to create herd-like mentalities and if people fail to question and logically investigate everything they are told, it is easy for lies and propaganda to spread. Fortunately, there are people like Chomsky who help lift the blinders from our eyes so that we may better see reality. Most of the time the truth is awful and against self-held morals and ethics. And it is depressing to know the ugly raw reality. However, I think that accurate knowledge of the past is the first step in improving the present and future.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="//amzn.com/1888363827" target="_blank">Profit Over People: Neoliberalism &amp; Global Order</a>,&nbsp;Noam Chomsky critiques the economic vogue held by a large number of economists and government officials during the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing to this day. In truth, it seems as if many of our climate and social problems stem from the concerns raised by Chomsky. If we as a species wish to continue living in a global community on Earth &#8212; enjoying the benefits of mutual aid and global economic prosperity to achieve a greater civilization, it seems that it is necessary to address the issues presented by Chomsky. Of course, working towards such an ideal society and generating such sublime goals is always optional. The foundation upon which rests all great civilizations is the confidence and power of its people to see and seize their own destiny. Read the book and you may begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watch it: <a href="//youtu.be/2bFOhAAYfqk" target="_blank">The Trials of Henry Kissinger (2002) </a></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Part contemporary investigation and part historical inquiry, documentary  follows the quest of one journalist in search of justice. The film  focuses on Christopher Hitchens&#8217; charges against Henry Kissinger as a  war criminal &#8211; allegations documented in <a href="//amzn.com/145552297X" target="_blank">Hitchens&#8217; book </a>of the same  title &#8211; based on his role in countries such as Cambodia, Chile, and  Indonesia. Kissinger&#8217;s story raises profound questions about American  foreign policy and highlights a new era of human rights. Increasing  evidence about one man&#8217;s role in a long history of human rights abuses  leads to a critical examination of American diplomacy through the lens  of international standards of justice.                <em>Written by <a href="//www.imdb.com/search/title?plot_author=Sujit%20R.%20Varma&amp;view=simple&amp;sort=alpha">Sujit R. Varma</a></em></p></blockquote>
