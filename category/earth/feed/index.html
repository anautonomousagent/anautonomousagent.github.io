				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Life&#8217;s Rocky Start</em> gives a decent educational account of the importance of minerals to both the formation (assuming life originated on Earth) and the progressive development of life. It is one of the few documentaries I have seen that properly shines light on the importance of meteorites to the understanding of planetary formation. The documentary starts by visiting Marrakesh, Morocco to show how meteorites are obtained in the infamous Northwest Africa region. I only wished it developed more on this meteorite theme.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was curious to learn about the Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics (WEDD) theory developed by J. Marvin Herndon after I discovered that Lynn Margulis had edited and recommended his work several years ago.  After purchasing <a href="http://amzn.com/1503041271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Herndon&#8217;s Earth and the Dark Side of Science</a> and reading the foreword by Dorion Sagan, whom I respect as an excellent science writer, I began to see Herndon as a scientist who is attempting to shake the foundations of more than three distinct subject areas &#8211; Geoscience, Planetary Sciences, and Nuclear Science. Whether or not you personally think his WEDD theory is right or wrong is irrelevant to the truth. If someone thinks his theory is incorrect, then they can refute the theory with substantive evidence by publishing a paper which details the inconsistencies in logic or facts. But remember, as Feyerabend and Kuhn note repeatedly, facts are always theory laden.</p>
<p>Science is not a religion; scientists are not priests who defend a fixed doctrine. Scientists who simply ridicule or resort to name calling are doing a disservice to science in a time when science is being attacked on many fronts &#8211; by religions, governments, and corporations. Scientists who forsake truth for tenure, personal prestige or their own beliefs are just as dangerous to science as any external threat. And this does not exclude Herndon himself.</p>
<p>As a reader of science subjects, I find the ideas of Herndon to be a fresh and fascinating departure from the status-quo. This is what science is all about, proposing preposterous ideas and then proving them right or wrong. His theory is nothing short of a revolution in the subjects previously mentioned. Even if it turns out to be false, they still provide food for thought and may even perhaps result in a more developed and better understanding of the true nature of natural phenomenon.</p>
<p>In light of all the exoplanet discoveries of the Kepler Space Telescope there is even more reason to seriously consider investigating the theories presented by Herdon. Of the thousands of exoplanets discovered thus far, there is a large fraction of Jupiter type planets which lie within the orbit of Earth. In fact there are so many such exoplanets that the question should not be: &#8220;Why are there so many Jupiter type planets in such close proximity to their host star?&#8221; but should rather be: &#8220;Why does our Solar System <em>not</em> contain Jupiter type planets within Earth&#8217;s orbit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even <em>if</em> Herdon&#8217;s theory is <em>incorrect</em> regarding the history of <em>our</em> Solar System, his proposed theory is a physical possibility, i.e. there is at least one planet or moon which has had its atmosphere stripped away in the universe. It would therefore be silly not to study the theory. Don&#8217;t mathematicians study topics which have no current application? What is the issue with studying situations that did not occur in our Solar System?</p>
<p>I suggest first reading: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Basis of Geoscience: Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics</a></p>
<p>and then reading his book mentioned earlier (his book also contains this paper, among others).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading books which made numerous references to the ideas of Vladimir Vernadsky, I decided to read his book, <a href="//amzn.com/038798268X">The Biosphere</a>. It is an insightful and important book which provides numerous novel insights into the interconnected nature of the entire biosphere &#8212; the biogeochemical and thermodynamic relationships between living and non-living matter. The 1998 publication with Editor M.A.S McMenamin contains hundreds of great footnotes and further references. I also enjoyed the informative introduction by Jacques Grinevald.</p>
<p>Vernadsky&#8217;s &#8220;Pressure of Life&#8221; concept is new to me and struck me as important. It should, theoretically, be a measurable pressure. Just as we can measure Pascals or Newtons of pressure, the same should be the case for life&#8217;s pressure. There is only the issue of determining the system&#8217;s extent and defining the measurable quantity. For example, the entire biosphere must exert a given pressure against the Earth&#8217;s geochemical resources given a flux of cosmic solar energy. The biosphere &#8220;wants&#8221; and &#8220;tries&#8221; to multiply and thus expand against the finite constraint of resources available to the current state of biospheric evolution. Copying Vernadsky&#8217;s own analogy of a farmer clearing land, the freshly cleared land has been removed of the majority of its life above the soil. Thus there exists a pressure to fill this &#8220;vacuum&#8221; of life. How can we measure this pressure?</p>
<p>This brings to mind the related ideas of the logistic function and the oscillations which occur due to population expansion against finite resources. Life seems to typically overshoot the carrying capacity  due to rapid initial multiplication. Only to later collapse and once again overshoot in a series of oscillations. Once the cleared land has been mostly filled, this pressure changes and occurs both inter- and intra- species.

In<a href="http://amzn.com/0198607830" target="_blank"> Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World</a>, Nick Lane presents many convincing arguments about the development of early life and the geological history of Earth &#8212; all based on Oxygen. Lane&#8217;s book is one of the best I have read about the ancient history of Earth and is a great resource to learn about anti-oxidants, LUCA, and the role of oxygen in biology. He has written other books which I hope to read.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to study the effects of meditation on oxygen respiration in the human body. Does anyone know of any such studies?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="//amzn.com/1888363827" target="_blank">Profit Over People: Neoliberalism &amp; Global Order</a>,&nbsp;Noam Chomsky critiques the economic vogue held by a large number of economists and government officials during the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing to this day. In truth, it seems as if many of our climate and social problems stem from the concerns raised by Chomsky. If we as a species wish to continue living in a global community on Earth &#8212; enjoying the benefits of mutual aid and global economic prosperity to achieve a greater civilization, it seems that it is necessary to address the issues presented by Chomsky. Of course, working towards such an ideal society and generating such sublime goals is always optional. The foundation upon which rests all great civilizations is the confidence and power of its people to see and seize their own destiny. Read the book and you may begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</div>

He mentioned the universal scaling law which exists in biological systems called the &nbsp;&#8220;3/4 power law,&#8221; (see&nbsp;<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber's_law" target="_blank">Kleiber&#8217;s Law</a>&nbsp;for an example).

<p><a href="//youtu.be/etfRE5-YlXs?t=1h25m30s" target="_blank">Watch the actual question on YouTube</a>.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">West&#8217;s response was interesting. He basically said that it would be likely only if these&nbsp;organisms&nbsp;followed the same networking&nbsp;structures&nbsp;and patterns which we observe in Earth&#8217;s biosphere (for example, most people are familiar with networks which are&nbsp;hierarchical). In other words, there may be network structures on other worlds, unfamiliar to any scientist here on Earth. If there exist such unknown networks which have guided the evolution of these alien organisms, then these&nbsp;organisms&nbsp;will not obey this &#8220;3/4 power law.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Fascinating response, especially considering the general <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/investigations-stuart-kauffman.html" target="_blank">Astro-Biology ideas of Kauffman</a>. These ideas hypothesize a biological science which can explain all life in the universe, not just life in Earth&#8217;s biosphere.</div>
