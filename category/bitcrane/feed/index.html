<p>I recently purchased and set-up the BitCrane Miner T-110S. Purchased on-sale at newegg for $598, it provides 1 TH/s of Bitcoin mining power. It was extremely easy to get the rig started and connected to my mining pool; less than five minutes out of the box. So far I am very impressed. This would make for a great gift to anyone interested in Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>My electricity costs are $0.11 per kWh per month. Since the T-110S consumes approximately 650 kWh per month operating 24/7 &#8212; $71.50 per month &#8212; it will take a number months to break even, depending on the exchange rate of Bitcoin. This boils down to about $2.31 per day in electric costs. And at 1 TH/s operating speed I earn approximately $3.90 &#8211; 4.50 per day depending on the difficulty level and exchange rate. With a fixed cost of $598 I should break even in 273 &#8211; 376 days.</p>
<p>However, it is interesting to note that the T-110S could be considered a space heater &#8212; not sure how efficient. This would in effect replace some of the cost of heating a home in the winter. Unfortunately, the costs will not outweigh the benefits during the summer months. I believe in the future of Bitcoin and its ability as a unit of exchange. The purpose of my purchase was mostly to gain a participatory experience and support Bitcoin &#8212; rather than profit seeking.</p>
<p>Update: After purchasing the T-110S I wanted to compare it with an Antminer. I therefore bought the<a href="//www.antminerdistribution.com/antminer-s5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Antminer S5</a>. The S5 consumes about 60% of the 900W consumed by the T-110S for the same GH/s and is easy to set-up. On the downside, the S5 is extremely loud and lacks a nice case and appearance.</p>
<p>I have moved both miners into the garage because I was tired of their whirring sounds. The move to the garage solved the sound problem and the temperature problem &#8211; since my garage is quite cold during the winter.</p>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">NOTE: After running the miner in the horizontal position, I found that the temperature decreases. I would recommend NOT placing the miner in the vertical position since the water coolers fans would be in-taking air from above &#8212; hot air rises, hence not an efficient mode of cooling.</div>
