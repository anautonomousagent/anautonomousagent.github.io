Well, I am certainly not a conspiracy &#8216;<em>theorist&#8217;</em> &#8230; When people take that position I have to laugh&#8230; because I feel sorry for them, they obviously never read a history book. Because anyone who knows anything about history knows that it&#8217;s built on conspiracies &#8212; from one end to the other. Conspiracy is the engine of history! Every major event in history, when you examine it, has come to pass largely as a result of at least one, and in many cases many conspiracies. And it goes on today.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Order can exist without a hierarchy, yet I constantly confront the word <em>anarchy</em> in contexts which assume its manipulated definition of disorder. This association degrades the ideas of political anarchists. To remedy this issue, I propose a new word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Autocosmocracy &#8211; a form of society in which the political relations between its members, without the aide of any hierarchical institution, continually gives rise to a self-organized society. A continuously existing society without a higher power structure; a system where authority lies in the absolute freedom of the individual. All members are autonomous agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world of the biologist is filled with organisms which are self-organized. In the natural sciences there are numerous phenomena in which order arises out of agents acting autonomously. Is not man himself a biological creature in the physical world?</p>
<p>Imagine a hypothetical situation where the form of civilization is an autocosmocracy &#8212; all individuals completely autonomous, bound by no institution. I would postulate that inevitably, after a certain number of generations, the civilization would form groups due to scarcity; and that these distinct groups will form their own government. These new groups will throw away the autocosmocratic forms and create novel political frameworks in order to achieve various goals. For instance, there is great dominating strength in having a mass of brutish men who will obey all commands unquestioningly. In other words, in an initial state of complete freedom and liberty, humans will group and band together. It can be shown mathematically that this will be the equilibrium state. Those individuals who fail to join a group will be out competed or destroyed by those who do join a group.</p>
<p>A similar situation occurs in the distributed cryptocurrency mining networks. This system, which is initially distributed with all individual miners acting autonomously, inevitably transforms into a network of groups due to competition and scarcity. So the natural question arises: how to prevent the formation of such groups in the presence of scarcity? Or is it a better question to ask how to eliminate scarcity?</p>
<p>In terms of Plato&#8217;s cave of shadows, it would be a society in which all members are able to discover the source of the shadows. All members would exist as philosopher kings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/wikileaks_accuses_facebook_of_censhorship_20160318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikileaks recently claimed</a> that Facebook censored their post on Hillary Clinton&#8217;s email dump. This suggests that users of Facebook are in no way guaranteed the right to post whatever they want. At the end of the day, it is Facebook Corporation (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quote: FB</a>) which has the final say on what should be publicly allowed on Facebook. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, this is the expected outcome of a free service existing as a centrally managed set of servers owned by special interests and shareholders.</p>
<p>The solution, not without its own disadvantages, would be to create and migrate all users to a decentralized social media network. I think this would be possible with <a href="https://namecoin.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecoin </a>in combination with WordPress (think <a href="https://buddypress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuddyPress</a>) where all users would have their own local servers or rent machines with services like Heroku, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/hosting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a>, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/running-wordpress-on-openshift-an-introduction--cms-20058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Openshift</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EC2</a>, etc.. The process should be simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>User rents machine on Heroku, Namecheap, Openshift, etc&#8230;</li>
<li>Install WordPress on this machine</li>
<li>Add WordPress social network plugin</li>
<li>Create Namecoin domain</li>
<li>Create user profile</li>
<li>Publish posts, socialize and message friends</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some current examples/ideas of people creating and implementing P2P social networks:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The papers, essays, and lectures contained in <a href="http://amzn.com/0226039056" target="_blank">Steps to an Ecology of Mind</a> showcase Gregory Bateson&#8217;s incredibly unique perspective. Due to the wide range of discussion within this collection, it is very difficult to write a concise summary. There are a few points which made a lasting impact in my mind.</p>
<p>He explains the levels of learning and how the animal mind can &#8220;learn about learning&#8221; and &#8220;think about thinking&#8221;; concerning humans &#8211; they can reach a third and possibly fourth level in this learning recursion hierarchy. He discusses this in the context of various subjects: anthropology, psychology, evolution, information, ecology, cybernetics and epistomoglogy in general.</p>
<p>He emphasizes that western science should adjust the way it thinks about <em>relationship and form</em> and discusses how these are relavant to the study of <em>matter and energy</em>. He questions the western conception of mammalian emotions, aesthetics, and the ego-self. On several occasions I found myself with the desire to re-read <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2012/12/godel-escher-bach-douglas-hofstadter/" target="_blank">Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter</a>. Both books I think contain some overlap in their treatment of information and the mind. Overall, Bateson was an incredible thinker and you will improve your intellect by reading this collection of work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These important films by Peter Joseph speak for themselves. I really did not have a clue what they were about until I started to read about Jacques Fresco and The Venus Project. I think the ideas presented in the Zeitgeist films represent a phase transition in modern society which will come to fruition this century. And whenever there is such a split/conflict concerning the removal and reshaping of a society&#8217;s establishment structures, we must ensure that it is done without violence. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the Zeitgeist movement is right or wrong about society&#8217;s problems; what matters is that it strikes a common chord in the population and brings people together under a common ideology. History repeats itself and this time is not different. The established power structures control the means of production and have enormous political power; they will not simply handover this power&#8230;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, if you have never seen documentaries or talks about Jacque Fresco, you should definitely do so now. He is quite a visionary. I can&#8217;t believe he was 58 years old in 1974 when <a href="https://youtu.be/VTfIdAfvxiQ" target="_blank">he was on Larry King</a>. And now nearly 100 years old. What an extraordinary life!</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5zn8MRKOskw" target="_blank">Future By Design</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KphWsnhZ4Ag" target="_blank">Paradise or Oblivion</a></p>
<p>An insightful speech from Mr. Jacque Fresco has caused me to wonder about our society and its future. I think he identifies the issues, but I can we fix them?</p>
<div class="youtube"
     id="OnkCww2ZeVs"
     style="width: 100%; height: 360px;">
</div>
<p>With regards to a resource based economy, I think we should be careful with how much we change and how quickly. We don&#8217;t want to &#8220;throw out the baby with the bath water&#8221; as the saying goes. In other words, there are numerous highly productive structures which exist today, along with detrimental ones. There is much we can do to restructure various institutions to achieve many of the goals listed in the Venus Project. For example, there is nothing that requires corporations and governments to be hierarchically organized. That form of structure existed before I was born and even before my father. Why do we still follow it? I once read a book, suggested by John Bogle, called <a href="https://greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/" target="_blank">Servant Leadership, by Robert K. Greenleaf</a>; in this book, Greenleaf puts forward ideas which reshape the structure of corporations and other institutions.</p>
<p>Anyway, just watch the talk and see what you think.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The Venus Project &#8211; The Choice is Ours</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//amzn.com/0691136963">Secular Cycles</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="http://peterturchin.com/">Peter Turchin</a> and Sergey A. Nefedov investigates the nature of biological and economic growth in combination with the characteristic social structures and power relationships unique to humans. This combination of Marxian and Malthusian analysis provides an interesting approach which can be developed to help predict future developments and understand how history develops.</p>
<p>The book (really an academic paper) is an analysis based on various data which have survived the ravages of time. It looks at cycles which occurred in various regions and times in the past, including Rome, France, England, and Russia. It shows how time after time humans progress, only to regress. And this &#8220;dis-integration&#8221; may be caused by either biological constraints <i>and/or </i>existing&nbsp;political structures.&nbsp;There also appears to be characteristic times which tend to correspond to successive generations or every other generation. And this wave or cyclical behavior is inherent in the complex system of homo-sapiens &#8212; being a social animal who spends 20+ years acquiring the knowledge and skills of ancestors.</p>
<p>I can only wish that more quantitative data were available to study ancient humans; ironically it is the &#8220;dis-integrative&#8221; phases of growth where data, observations, and history are destroyed and lost forever. Perhaps the next &#8220;integrative&#8221; phase of societal growth is a function of how much information is preserved from the previous &#8220;integrative&#8221; phase (think about Library of Alexandria). Formulaic conclusions based upon detailed and consistent data extending to the remote reaches of the past may forever be lost. Sometimes this data can be cleverly reconstructed (<a href="//www.lehigh.edu/~inarcmet/papers/pense%201992.pdf" target="_blank">see here</a>). Most of the time the data can not be obtained and this should serve to emphasize the importance of preserving the Noosphere for the sake of future societies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">In&nbsp;<a href="//amzn.com/1888363827" target="_blank">Profit Over People: Neoliberalism &amp; Global Order</a>,&nbsp;Noam Chomsky critiques the economic vogue held by a large number of economists and government officials during the last quarter of the 20th century and continuing to this day. In truth, it seems as if many of our climate and social problems stem from the concerns raised by Chomsky. If we as a species wish to continue living in a global community on Earth &#8212; enjoying the benefits of mutual aid and global economic prosperity to achieve a greater civilization, it seems that it is necessary to address the issues presented by Chomsky. Of course, working towards such an ideal society and generating such sublime goals is always optional. The foundation upon which rests all great civilizations is the confidence and power of its people to see and seize their own destiny. Read the book and you may begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</div>
