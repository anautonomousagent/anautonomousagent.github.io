				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These videos provide a fascinating look at the history and ongoing development of <a href="http://www.auroville.org/" target="_blank">Auroville</a> (City of the Dawn). Founded by Mirra Alfassa as a project of the Sri Aurobindo Society, it provides an example of a community designed to inspire unity and lead the way forward for humanity.</p>
<p>City of the Dawn is a summary of the city&#8217;s foundation and history since the late 1960&#8217;s and early 1970&#8217;s:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, if you have never seen documentaries or talks about Jacque Fresco, you should definitely do so now. He is quite a visionary. I can&#8217;t believe he was 58 years old in 1974 when <a href="https://youtu.be/VTfIdAfvxiQ" target="_blank">he was on Larry King</a>. And now nearly 100 years old. What an extraordinary life!</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5zn8MRKOskw" target="_blank">Future By Design</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KphWsnhZ4Ag" target="_blank">Paradise or Oblivion</a></p>
<p>An insightful speech from Mr. Jacque Fresco has caused me to wonder about our society and its future. I think he identifies the issues, but I can we fix them?</p>

<p>With regards to a resource based economy, I think we should be careful with how much we change and how quickly. We don&#8217;t want to &#8220;throw out the baby with the bath water&#8221; as the saying goes. In other words, there are numerous highly productive structures which exist today, along with detrimental ones. There is much we can do to restructure various institutions to achieve many of the goals listed in the Venus Project. For example, there is nothing that requires corporations and governments to be hierarchically organized. That form of structure existed before I was born and even before my father. Why do we still follow it? I once read a book, suggested by John Bogle, called <a href="https://greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/" target="_blank">Servant Leadership, by Robert K. Greenleaf</a>; in this book, Greenleaf puts forward ideas which reshape the structure of corporations and other institutions.</p>
<p>Anyway, just watch the talk and see what you think.</p>
