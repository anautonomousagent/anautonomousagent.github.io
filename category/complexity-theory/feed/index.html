				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do there exist studies on the distribution of the lengths of kingdoms and dynasties &#8212; &nbsp;distinct political entities &#8212; since the 3rd millennium B.C.E.? It seems likely that someone has already studied this topic, but I can not find any papers online. To explain, I have included a file, <a href="//speedy.sh/qez3J/DynastiesAndKingdoms.csv" target="_blank">here</a>, containing the beginning and end dates of about 700 distinct social groups since the dawn of recorded history. It was complied from various Wikipedia pages. I do not doubt that the data is not very reliable, however, graphing the histogram of these lengths, see Figure 1, would provide at least a rough idea of their distribution.</p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Histogram-of-Dynasty-Kingdom-Lifespan1.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Histogram-of-Dynasty-Kingdom-Lifespan1.png" height="320" width="400" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Figure 1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It does seem that a nice distribution curve exists which models the data. The distribution seems to take the shape of a power law at first glance. Doing some work in R, I found that a power law with one set of parameters fits the tail nicely but fails to fit the first half; and vice versa, a power law with a different set of parameters fits the majority but not the tail. My hypothesis is that a power law with alpha equal to 3 may be the best fit. This is a prediction based on the <a href="//anautonomousagent.com/?p=185" target="_blank">lectures of Geoffrey West</a>, in which he explains that most biological systems exhibit power law distributions with alpha in the 2.5-3.0 range. However, as seen in Figure 2, this does not seem to be the correct range for alpha if a power law is the best fit for this preliminary data.</p>
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/EmpericalvsTheoretical1.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/EmpericalvsTheoretical1.png" height="310" width="400" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Figure 2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>The tail of the distribution does not fit well with the parameters shown in Figure 2.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would venture to guess that the data may not be reliable in the displayed tail region. This would suggest that the data may need improvement in the portion where kingdoms and dynasties exist for longer than 200 years. The data I compiled, may of course be missing many kingdoms and dynasties. I believe that my sample is biased, due to these missing kingdoms and dynasties.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>To improve this rough sketch of the distribution of kingdoms and dynasties, a highly systematic method must be devised to correctly measure the length of time of existence for any dynasty and kingdom. Also, this method must consistently be able to distinguish when a kingdom or dynasty begins and ends. The general idea is to measure the length of existence of a distinct political entity in a geographical region.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A sample must be obtained which is not biased. A dataset containing the population of all existing kingdoms and dynasties existing since the 3rd millinium B.C.E. would work best. Even so, this would be biased because it would ignore all the dynasties and kingdoms existing before that time.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Eric Cline&#8217;s book, <a href="//amzn.com/0691140898" target="_blank">1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed</a>, provides a scholarly summary on the rise and decline of the bronze age in the Mediterranean region. Citing a number of different reasons for collapse, I find the most interesting to be a complex systemic failure arising from a continuous wave of natural disasters combined with external attacks by &#8220;sea peoples&#8221; which the &#8220;global&#8221; system could not withstand. These shocks were applied to the ancient system at its peak, in terms of power and interconnectedness, which indicates that collapses seem to occur near peaks, not troughs, in societal wealth and prosperity. And several civilizations tend to disappear at the same time; much as species extinction tends to occur in clusters. Chinese dynasties, Mesopotamian cities, Persian kings, the Mongols, the Romans and countless other examples show the same pattern.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I am interested in seeing a frequency plot showing the number of states, governments, societies which last a given length of time (similar to <a href="//larryfreeman.hubpages.com/hub/How-long-do-empires-last" target="_blank">here</a> except with plots; the average tells us nothing about the shape of the distribution). And if no such plot exists I will try to create one. Collapse occurs time and time again in the history of humans and biological evolution. To me, this seems to indicate a natural law of growth which applies to all biological growth phenomena. And such a law has been mentioned by Robert Prechter and provides a basis for mathematical analysis.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Stock prices, as seen by many appear to be purely random processes with no patterns and thus no predictability. And more often than not, people unfamiliar with stochastic processes will equate the work of financial engineers as &#8220;hocus-pocus,&#8221; &#8220;rocket science,&#8221; or just plan gambling. Are these people correct? Are asset managers playing roulette with the public&#8217;s money? If so, then it would seem that the life work of people such as Ito, Merton, Black, Scholes, Hull, Cox, White, Detemple, Sornette, and others amount to no more than speculation or the ramblings of an inmate in an insane asylum. Assuming otherwise, and that there is method to the madness of these academics, prices are predictable. And stochastic calculus provides a framework with which to build predictions. But how well and how reliable are the calculations? How can we use this predictability to properly manage risk?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There are at least two important responsibilities for risk managers:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. Risk managers must make rational decisions. An empirical and purely quantitative forecast of future returns should be made with a clear understand of model assumptions.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. With the foresight provided by the model, a suitable strategy must be taken. If the observations are indicating current market bubble conditions, then managers should be selling, or at the very least not buying.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">These responsibilities are general and do not depend on the model being implemented to forecast returns. The accuracy of the forecast depends greatly on the assumptions used to create the model. The majority of models assume:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. That returns are independent in time.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. That volatility is constant.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3. That markets are efficient.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. That prices follow the Geometric Brownian Motion</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, most models assume that human emotions, psychology, and behavior are not factors in determining the price movements of assets. How can such critical factors be ignored by financial engineers? The number of papers dealing with the effects of behavior on stochastic equations are few. Instead, the academic community has and continues to brush off these factors with the wrongly conceptualized idea that the sum total of all human interactions will create Brownian Motion. The billions of collisions on a grain of pollen in H<sub>2</sub>O are what stirred the creation of this type of stochastic process. So, the question is: Can we equate the process which creates Browian Motion as observed by Brown himself, to the structure of asset price movement? One is created through thermal random thermal interactions; the other through human emotion, psychology, and behaviour.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Risk managers should realize these assumptions and they should be cautious.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If risk managers believe in the predicatablity of prices, then we must, by force of principle assume that there is an underlying structure. In other words, consider the prediction of Earthquakes. The fact that we even consider the ability to predict their occurrence suggests that we have some degree of knowledge regarding their underlying structure. By believing in the predictability of price trajectories, we naturally assume some underlying structure. But what is this structure? How do we monitor the processes at work?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Are returns predictable? According to much research, the answer to this question is a firm, yes. But arbitrage theory says that such predicatablity can not exist. So, what does the risk manager believe? Does he believe that prices are Brownian Motions; that markets are efficient machines, not affected by the emotions, psychology, and behavior of humans; or does he disregard these assumptions in search for a better stochastic model? The answer to this question lies in controversy and may not be resolved for a long time. However, the risk manager has 100 billion of assets which he must manage today. Where is he to look for alternative models which disregard the assumptions of his collegues and predecessors? This paper provides the beginning of one such alternative.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This paper presents a stochastic model of the form: change(price) = function(volume). The volume depends on a matrix with a fixed number of agents. The intuition behind this model comes from the concept that a stock price&#8217;s movement should reflect not a normal distribution, which has roots in the idea of Brownian motion and particles in heat transfer, but rather a bi-directional &#8220;tug-of-war&#8221; between agents who are buying and selling with human emotions, psychology, and behavior. Just as in the youthful tug-of-war game, there are times when it appears that the right side has the upper hand, when, all of the sudden the left side makes a determined effort and brings down the right side. These drastic and rapid phase transitions are unheard of in a Brownian idea of price movements. The Brownian application to asset price movements provide a decent first approximation. However, stochastic processes with Brownian Motion will never evolve in a manner to explain the stylized facts observed from the actual distribution of asset returns. Thus, to truly model price behavior, practitioners should study the fundamental structure of the market.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Consider this thought experiment:&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Take a snapshot of all market participants in a security XYZ. This is period zero (t = 0). Suppose there are a fixed number, N, total people in the financial system who can own and trade XYZ. In other words, the price movement of this asset should depend only on the actions of these N traders. Now count the number of traders who currently hold a short position in XYZ and a long position in XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub>and L<sub>0</sub> represent the number of traders who are currently short and long, respectively, the asset XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub> + L<sub>0</sub>&lt; N, thus there are a number of traders, H<sub>0</sub>, who hold neither a short nor a long position. Thus, H<sub>0</sub> = N – S<sub>0</sub>– L<sub>0</sub>. The current price of XYZ is P<sub>0</sub>. Assume that all transactions only involve 1 share of XYZ. Further posts will seek to address the important consideration of number of shares.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now consider the next possible moves for all traders in the market (t = 1). There are assumed to be four possibilities:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">An XYZ owner with a long position sells. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A trader short XYZ covers his/her position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a long position. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a short position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0 </sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, numbers 1 and 2 increase the number of neutral traders, while 3 and 4 decrease that number. Assume that both 2 and 3 cause the price of XYZ to increase by some factor and 1 and 4 decrease the price of XYZ by the same factor. Thus the movement of the price of XYZ should be a bi-directional “tug-of-war” battle: traders going long and shorts covering versus traders shorting and longs selling.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">To represent this computationally, a matrix can be created which holds the current state of all traders. To create the initial state matrix, called StateMatrix<sub>0</sub>, form an <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N x <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N square matrix (for simplification, it would be best to choose N as a perfect square). Then fill the matrix randomly with the value -1 for the correct number of traders short XYZ, S<sub>0</sub>. Do likewise with L<sub>0</sub>and H<sub>0</sub>, represented by 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, the initial StateMatrix<sub>0</sub> will be randomly filled with {-1,0,1}, representing the traders who are short, neutral, and long.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now, proceed one period to t = 1. To calculate the next StateMatix<sub>1</sub>, do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Assume that each trader is influenced by U of his peers and that this influence is proportional to a factor representing the general market “mood.” Call the mood factor for the current period, M<sub>t</sub>. To find what the trader will do in the transition from t = 0 to t =1, sum the values of his U neighbors, find their average, multiply by the current M<sub>t</sub> and round. In addition, include a possibility for&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;to form his own&nbsp;independent value {-1,0,1} and ignore his U neighbors with probability, IDIO (an idiosyncratic change of asset position).</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For example, suppose that at t = 0, trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> of the matrix was short, i.e. the value was -1 and that his 4 neighbors at i = 0 had values {1,0,1,-1}.&nbsp;Suppose the M<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;at this time is 1.2 and IDIO = 0.20. If this&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;does not choose an idiosyncratic position, then he mimics his neighbors.&nbsp;The sum of his four neighbors is thus&nbsp;SumTrader<sub>[i,j]</sub> = 1 + 0 + 1 – 1 = 1 and the average is ¼. Thus ¼*1.2 = 0.3. Rounding give a value of 0. Thus, the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> should change his value to 0, in other words the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> will cover his position.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Performing this calculation for every trader on the grid will create the StateMatrix<sub>1</sub>. And doing this for T periods will create a&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence of trader states. To calculate the actual price movement based on this&nbsp;model do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Calculate the difference,&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>and divide by N. Multiply by P<sub>t</sub>. This value = C, the change in the price from the previous price</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Price<sub>t+1</sub> = Price<sub>t</sub>+ C</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">This will form the evolution of the price through the states of the&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence.  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Note: In order to make the M<sub>t</sub>factor suitable, its values must fall between [0,1.5). If not, then values of the traders<sub>[i,j]</sub> may be other than {-1,0,1}. The M<sub>t</sub> factor can be calculated at each period with the following calculation:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">M<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;= #L<sub>t-1</sub>/#S<sub>t-1</sub></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the Mood factor M<sub>t</sub>for the next period is the ratio of the number of current traders who are long to the number of current traders who are short. There may be other ways to define this factor.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Look at the previous <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/11/simulated-stock-price-data-ising-type.html" target="_blank">post, here</a>, to see an example. In that post I used:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">N = 1,000,000</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">T = 700</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">U = 4</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">L<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">IDIO = 0.19</div>
</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">The works of Didier Sornette and others show that Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) oscillations occur before financial crashes. Implementing the ideas found in various papers, the following graphs were created. As can be seen from the following graphs, peaks in the periodogram signals occurs shortly before some of the crashes.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">I created a blog devoted to exploring these LPPL market signals: <a href="//lpplmarketwatch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">LPPL Market Watch</a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Update: new website devoted to this subject. Visit: <a href="//www.thebubbleindex.com/" target="_blank">The Bubble Index</a>.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Summary of Research</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Recent research by Didier Sornette and his colleagues suggests that market crashes are predictable phenomenon. Even though economists debate the existence of crashes and their precursors &#8211; bubbles, &nbsp;there exists historical proof of Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) oscillations occurring immediately before all recorded major market declines in all major stock indices. For example, these LPPL oscillations occurred in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 shortly before the crashes of 1929, 1987, and 2000.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">With the aide of Sornette’s previous papers on market crashes, a “bubble index” is created. The bubble index displays the likelihood of a market bubble at any given time. With an index like this as a tool, any investment strategy which seeks to time the market will be highly successful. The bubble index indicates when to change asset positions in preparation for an incoming crash. One application of the bubble index is for financial planners and investment managers to change their client’s asset allocations accordingly. As the bubble index spikes, a crash is near. After the crash occurs the bubble index returns to low levels, indicating that the crash is over.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">A bubble index for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 is formed with the methods presented in this paper. Remarkably, the 1929, 1962, 1987, and 2000 crashes are all predicted at least a week before the actual crash. In the weeks prior to these crashes there is a large spike in the index. After the crash occurs, the index returns to low levels. Interestingly, the bubble index for these indices only spikes during a crash. In other words, given that a spike has occurred, there is a 100% probability that a crash has or will occur. However, some of the crashes are not predicted by spikes in the bubble index. For instance, In both indices the 1968, 1972, and the 2008 crash show no spike in the index before or during the event.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">These LPPL signals indicate that crashes are not related to changes in technology, culture, economic policies, etc&#8230; In other words, financial markets have patterns which suggest an underlying structural instability during crashes. This supports Sornette&#8217;s belief that financial crashes are critical&nbsp;phenomena&nbsp;resulting from the complex interactions of traders. To me, this suggests that the natural sciences have a key place in finance.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">The implications of these results are rather enormous, since the index is simple to create and understand. The ability to leave the market before a crash and enter after the event provides a wonderful opportunity to earn excess returns while preserving capital. This bubble index should be run on a daily basis to allow an investment manager or financial planner to gain an awareness of current stability conditions. If the bubble index is widely viewed and accepted as a legitimate and reliable forecast of bubbles and crashes, then crash prevention may be possible at the macro level.</div>
