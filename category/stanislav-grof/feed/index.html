				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0887065414" target="_blank">The Adventure of Self-Discovery</a> by Stanislav Grof is a fascinating book which introduces readers to the inner healing potential of their sub-conscious. The first half of the book builds on themes from <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/realms-of-the-human-unconscious-observations-from-lsd-research-dr-stanislav-grof/" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious</a>. In the second half of the book, Grof explains the rather profound, yet simple, exercise of holotropic breathing. Holotropic breathing allows people access to the ancient tradition of entering non-ordinary states of consciousness without any recourse to the ingestion or smoking of plant material. Please read the entire book if you are interested in performing the breathing without the aid of an experienced holotropic guide. Do not attempt without a sitter.</p>
<p>I put together a music playlist based on Grof&#8217;s recommendations for your benefit. The songs are in random order. Let me know if I should add/remove any:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBs1i4JVDXzQrZTn0walmn8x" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Beginning</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBvSKlFNzRk2TEIW8nKZq12i" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Middle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBsL2-Ln2m1_XmhUYwHYkDun" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; End</a></p>
<p>Also, informative interview with Grof:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching an <a href="https://youtu.be/6rgYz_BU2Ew" target="_blank">interview with Michael Talbot</a> on YouTube, I was eager to read his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/0062014102" target="_blank">The Holographic Universe</a>. Despite being published in 1991, the book contains a wide range of references and resources perfect for any reader in 2016 interested in the boundary between science and the paranormal. I recommend this book, not because it provides profound new insight, but because of the huge number of paranormal examples (if legitimate) and historical occurrences with which any reader may have a difficult time fitting into their framework of reality. Of course, it is unwise to accept anything you read as truth; however, the source material is listed and the reader can stroll down any path he/she wishes in their own personal investigation of these topics. My own path is now taking me into the work of Dr. Stanislav Grof,  Rick Strassman, etc&#8230; and topics such as LSD, DMT, NDEs and OBEs.</p>
