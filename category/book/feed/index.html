				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered <a href="http://a.co/be19wcF">The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard</a>, by David Talbot, and let it collect dust for many months. What a mistake! It must be one of the most eye-opening books about covert power structures in America. Thanks to the writing style and organization, it was hard to put the book down. It should be a must read for any serious student of the time period 1950-1970. In some ways it nicely interweaves with the final chapters of Carroll Quigley&#8217;s <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/10/tragedy-and-hope-carroll-quigley/">Tragedy and Hope</a> which was published in 1964 without knowledge of the many facts publicly released and discovered since Quigley&#8217;s publication. Indeed, consider this: in 1927 Allen Dulles became the 2nd director of the Council on Foreign Relations and from 1933 to 1944 he was the Council&#8217;s secretary. The are too many astounding observations to write them all here. Do yourself a favor and read the book.<br />
Many reviewers claim that <a href="http://a.co/ey4sLkC">JFK and the Unspeakable</a> is a slightly better book regarding the JFK assassination; however, it seems the overall consensus is that The Devil&#8217;s Chessboard is the best book on Allen Welsh Dulles, John Foster Dulles, James Jesus Angleton and the early history of the CIA.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a>, by David Graeber, is a fascinating and astounding look at the ubiquity of debt in human affairs. It replaces many &#8220;accepted&#8221; theories on the origins of money and debt and disproves the Myth of Barter by studying the anthropological record. From my own experience, economic theories and models are almost never based on actual historical observations, only upon assumptions about human behavior and interaction that I personally find naive. Just look at the Efficient Market Hypothesis or the idea that humans are rational decision makers &#8212; these ideas or their assumptions quickly fall apart with a simple analysis. People can lie and manipulate; they can be greedy or ascetic. It is nice to finally have a down-to-Earth study of actual historical accounts of human interactions without forcing the current paradigm on the past. Graeber&#8217;s book provides a wake-up call for people to see a more realistic view of the interactions of humans, debt, markets, government and money.</p>

The book, despite being 1000+ pages, is easily readable thanks to Fisk&#8217;s incredible stories of adventure, harrowing near death experiences, and interviews with interesting people. Fisk interviewed and reported on some of the areas most notorious figures such as Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini, among others. This is <em>the</em> book to read to have a proper introduction and realistic, albeit with a Western perspective, understanding of historical events in the Middle East.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching Chris Hedges&#8217; interview with Sheldon Wolin, I desired to read Wolin&#8217;s books. <em>Democracy Incorporated</em> provided a creative perspective with which to interpret recent American political and social events. Upon completion, I had an urge to continue extracting the political ideas of Wolin and I concluded that the best way to do this would be to jump into the deep end and open his book, <a href="https://amzn.com/0691126275" target="_blank">Politics and Vision</a>. Not only do I now have incredible respect for his ideas but I also feel that he has broadened my personal awareness of my place in society and history. There are criticisms I have toward the content (exclusively focused on &#8220;European/American&#8221;), but they are rather minimal in scope compared to the benefits any reader would gain by reading it thoroughly. I would say that <em>Politics and Vision</em>, as time progresses, will turn out to be one of the most important books I have ever read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/069114589X" target="_blank">Democracy Incorporated</a>, Sheldon Wolin analyzes the current (2010 preface) American polity and its historical development. Every line is eye opening and revelatory, especially for those Americans who have been living in a virtual-reality cave for the past 15 years and/or have not been able to find the leisure time to discover what is slowly happening to their beloved society. The already aware reader will immediately identify with Wolin&#8217;s perspective and understand his point &#8212; that the government can be considered a corporate government. He makes it clear that despite calling their government a <em>democracy</em>, the American people live in a &#8220;managed democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a path to legitimate democracy is to be successful, the people themselves must begin the renewal process by creating a democratic ethos in every individual &#8212; the revolution must come from within each citizen. Change will not come from the elites who promise change!</p>
<p>Wolin is poignantly critical of certain groups of political elites who insist, unwaveringly, that the founding fathers and the Constitution are outside the sphere of critique. These foundations for American &#8220;managed democracy&#8221; are treated as if they were created and inspired by divinity. Of course, Wolin does not suggest that the foundations should be abolished. They should be improved, clarified, and refined as required by developments in technology and culture. He points out the hypocrisy in the rhetoric of politicians &#8212; that they simultaneously deify and nullify the Constitution. At every opportunity, politicians and government officials attempt to subvert the powers they swore to protect.</p>
<p>Wolin&#8217;s book is a must read for any democratically inclined citizen and every American!</p>
<p>The following is one of the only video interviews of Wolin I could find:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The papers, essays, and lectures contained in <a href="http://amzn.com/0226039056" target="_blank">Steps to an Ecology of Mind</a> showcase Gregory Bateson&#8217;s incredibly unique perspective. Due to the wide range of discussion within this collection, it is very difficult to write a concise summary. There are a few points which made a lasting impact in my mind.</p>
<p>He explains the levels of learning and how the animal mind can &#8220;learn about learning&#8221; and &#8220;think about thinking&#8221;; concerning humans &#8211; they can reach a third and possibly fourth level in this learning recursion hierarchy. He discusses this in the context of various subjects: anthropology, psychology, evolution, information, ecology, cybernetics and epistomoglogy in general.</p>
<p>He emphasizes that western science should adjust the way it thinks about <em>relationship and form</em> and discusses how these are relavant to the study of <em>matter and energy</em>. He questions the western conception of mammalian emotions, aesthetics, and the ego-self. On several occasions I found myself with the desire to re-read <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2012/12/godel-escher-bach-douglas-hofstadter/" target="_blank">Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter</a>. Both books I think contain some overlap in their treatment of information and the mind. Overall, Bateson was an incredible thinker and you will improve your intellect by reading this collection of work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0887065414" target="_blank">The Adventure of Self-Discovery</a> by Stanislav Grof is a fascinating book which introduces readers to the inner healing potential of their sub-conscious. The first half of the book builds on themes from <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/realms-of-the-human-unconscious-observations-from-lsd-research-dr-stanislav-grof/" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious</a>. In the second half of the book, Grof explains the rather profound, yet simple, exercise of holotropic breathing. Holotropic breathing allows people access to the ancient tradition of entering non-ordinary states of consciousness without any recourse to the ingestion or smoking of plant material. Please read the entire book if you are interested in performing the breathing without the aid of an experienced holotropic guide. Do not attempt without a sitter.</p>
<p>I put together a music playlist based on Grof&#8217;s recommendations for your benefit. The songs are in random order. Let me know if I should add/remove any:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBs1i4JVDXzQrZTn0walmn8x" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Beginning</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu5OLBTMJfBvSKlFNzRk2TEIW8nKZq12i" target="_blank">Holotropic Breathing &#8211; Middle</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching an <a href="https://youtu.be/6rgYz_BU2Ew" target="_blank">interview with Michael Talbot</a> on YouTube, I was eager to read his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/0062014102" target="_blank">The Holographic Universe</a>. Despite being published in 1991, the book contains a wide range of references and resources perfect for any reader in 2016 interested in the boundary between science and the paranormal. I recommend this book, not because it provides profound new insight, but because of the huge number of paranormal examples (if legitimate) and historical occurrences with which any reader may have a difficult time fitting into their framework of reality. Of course, it is unwise to accept anything you read as truth; however, the source material is listed and the reader can stroll down any path he/she wishes in their own personal investigation of these topics. My own path is now taking me into the work of Dr. Stanislav Grof,  Rick Strassman, etc&#8230; and topics such as LSD, DMT, NDEs and OBEs.</p>
