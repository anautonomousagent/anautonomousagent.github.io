				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is exciting to learn about the potential of geopolymers as an important construction material to be used in 3D printers. If the perfect geopolymer mixture, designed for 3D printing on an industrial scale, structures of any shape and design can be easily produced. And these structures will have extreme durability, efficiency, low cost, and load bearing strength. Perhaps we will construct modern day pyramids out of such a technology.</p>

<p>The still standing ancient structures at Giza, the Great Pyramids, are a standing testament to the durability and strength of geopolymer material designed to perfection.Â  It is incredible that a technology developed by ancient humans (Egyptians and possibly Mesopotamians) will be the future of modern construction design. It really shows you the important of sharing and preserving information.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed Joseph Davidovits&#8217; book, <a href="//anautonomousagent.com/?p=60" target="_blank">Why the Pharaohs Built the Pyramids with Fake Stones</a>, then you will definitely find Margaret Morris&#8217; book, <a href="//www.margaretmorrisbooks.com/" target="_blank">The Great Pyramid Secret</a> to be equally thrilling. In my opinion, it goes into more detail and depth than Davidovits&#8217; book. Both are worth a read.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s becoming increasingly clear that their ideas explain the key to the success of the Egyptians in building objects from diorite, hard limestone, quartizite, etc&#8230; The simple, but elegant solution of Geopolymers.</p>
<p>I think Jean-Pierre Houdin&#8217;s theory about the spiral ramp would be perfect, except change his theory from carved rocks to agglomerated stones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">While reading <a href="//amzn.com/0880295554" target="_blank">The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved</a>, by Joseph Davidovits and Margaret Morris, I was immediately impressed by the seemingly simple, yet controversial suggestion that the pyramids were built from artificial, synthetic stones. Who would have thought?!?! Davidovits&#8217; argument, evidence, and overall logic for Egypt&#8217;s Old Kingdom construction of sacred tombs and statues from geopolymeric stone (similar to concrete) convinces me that we have answered the question, &#8220;How were the pyramids built?&#8221; Warning! I am no Egyptologist, however, the evidence exists and the pieces of the puzzle fit nicely into place. Both in terms of the physical construction and the religious aspects of Khnum vs. Amun. The Old Kingdom Egyptians were master alchemists and could create high quality artificial stones thanks to their excellent skills and suitable geology/environment. Davidovits provides more details, examples, and experiments in his second book, <a href="//amzn.com/2951482043" target="_blank">Why the Pharaohs Built the Pyramids with Fake Stones</a>.</div>
<p>There are several videos and more information at the <a href="//www.geopolymer.org/archaeology/pyramids" target="_blank">Geopolymer Institute</a>.</p>
