				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you know about the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> project and wondered how to get the address requests to work seamlessly within your browser, there is a Firefox Add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/">IPFS Companion</a>. From the add-on&#8217;s description:</p>
<blockquote><p>This add-on enables everyone to access ipfs.io (or any other public gateway) urls the way they were meant: from locally running IPFS daemon 🙂</p></blockquote>
<p>To get things running, all you have to do is start your IPFS daemon and then start the add-on. By default both attach to localhost 127.0.0.1:8080. Make sure they both are using the same address. And that&#8217;s all! Now every time you visit a site pointing to an IPFS gateway, for instance: ipfs.io gateway.ipfs.io ipfs.pics, it will automatically send the request and receive the response via your IPFS daemon. Pretty awesome! I can&#8217;t thank the developers enough &#8211; <a href="http://lidel.org/">Marcin Rataj</a> and <a href="http://daviddias.me/">David Dias</a>. You can try it with my own IPFS site: <a href="http://lpplmarketwatch.com/">LPPL Market Watch</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Informative videos on free (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_Freedom">Free as in Freedom</a>) software and open source software. Richard Stallman is a great leader for software freedom and seems to be the source of the stereotype for computer programmer &#8220;looks&#8221;.</p>
<p>The difference between free and open-source software was not clear to me until after watching these videos and doing further research. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy">Wikipedia article on the naming of GNU/Linux</a>.</p>
<p>I personally encourage readers to consider switching to a GNU/Linux operating system or a distribution like Debian if they have not already. If you prefer having a hard copy of the OS or do not have the technical know-how to perform the image download-transfer-install process, <a href="https://www.osdisc.com/">OSDisc.com</a> is a great site to order many different distributions.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to become a supporter of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/help/help.html">GNU</a> by joining the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">UPDATE (2016-Feb-01):</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Upgraded from HD 650 to HD 800. Now in audiophile heaven. Also, added SOtM internal USB port with SOtM SATA In-Line power filter.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I recently switched my computer&#8217;s audio system from the Objective2 Amplifier and ObjectiveDAC (a good low-cost set-up) to the <a href="//www.teac.com/product/ud-501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TEAC USB AUDIO DAC UD-501</a>. I connected the TEAC to a spare laptop running <a href="//www.ap-linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audiophile Linux</a>. Listening with Sennheiser&#8217;s HD 650 headphones, the system playing native <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSD</a> albums sounds remarkable. All instruments and vocals are crystal clear and superbly smooth. It&#8217;s the way music was meant to be heard.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="//anautonomousagent.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/900x900px-LL-9d60ffd2_DSC_07551.jpeg"><img src="//anautonomousagent.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/900x900px-LL-9d60ffd2_DSC_07551.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="212" border="0" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">DSD is the future of music &#8212; beautiful high quality audio. With a well produced DSD album, it sounds as if you are at the recording studio with the artist. Granted that a typical DSD album can be around 2-4 GB, it is rather disappointing that people seem to prefer poor quality MP3 recordings playing on low quality DAC chips in iPods and cell phones. NOTE: If you want a portable option, see the <a href="//dagogo.com/geek-wave-worlds-first-portable-player-capable-32bit-384-khz-native-dsd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geek Wave</a>. An MP3 album is less than half the cost of a DSD album, but it is also less than half the quality IMO. I don&#8217;t think many people are aware of how amazing DSD quality music played back with professional quality electronics can sound. Since we live in a time where hard drives in the 2-4 TB range are rather cheap, I hope that consumers begin to demand that music producers focus on providing high fidelity music.</div>

It is one of the better documentaries I have every seen and definitely worth watching; however, I agree with the reviewer John Preston who said it had an &#8220;&#8230;infuriating glibness too as the web of connectedness became ever more stretched. No one could dispute that Curtis has got a very big bite indeed. But what about the chewing, you ask.

Most information about short sells, margin levels, and ownership levels are hidden; revealed only on a monthly or quarterly basis. This infrequent update hinders the development and understanding of crash prevention. Combining all of this information into a visual display based on an Ising model (<a href="//anautonomousagent.github.io/?p=124" target="_blank">example</a>) and N-Body particle simulation should be informative. Of course I am simply speculating and putting thoughts into words. The two books I am currently browsing through are: <a href="//amzn.com/1617290173" target="_blank">OpenCL in Action</a> by Matthew Scarpino and <a href="//amzn.com/0321809467" target="_blank">CUDA Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to GPU Programming</a> by Nicholas Wilt.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Stock prices, as seen by many appear to be purely random processes with no patterns and thus no predictability. And more often than not, people unfamiliar with stochastic processes will equate the work of financial engineers as &#8220;hocus-pocus,&#8221; &#8220;rocket science,&#8221; or just plan gambling. Are these people correct? Are asset managers playing roulette with the public&#8217;s money? If so, then it would seem that the life work of people such as Ito, Merton, Black, Scholes, Hull, Cox, White, Detemple, Sornette, and others amount to no more than speculation or the ramblings of an inmate in an insane asylum. Assuming otherwise, and that there is method to the madness of these academics, prices are predictable. And stochastic calculus provides a framework with which to build predictions. But how well and how reliable are the calculations? How can we use this predictability to properly manage risk?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There are at least two important responsibilities for risk managers:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. Risk managers must make rational decisions. An empirical and purely quantitative forecast of future returns should be made with a clear understand of model assumptions.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. With the foresight provided by the model, a suitable strategy must be taken. If the observations are indicating current market bubble conditions, then managers should be selling, or at the very least not buying.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">These responsibilities are general and do not depend on the model being implemented to forecast returns. The accuracy of the forecast depends greatly on the assumptions used to create the model. The majority of models assume:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. That returns are independent in time.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. That volatility is constant.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3. That markets are efficient.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. That prices follow the Geometric Brownian Motion</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, most models assume that human emotions, psychology, and behavior are not factors in determining the price movements of assets. How can such critical factors be ignored by financial engineers? The number of papers dealing with the effects of behavior on stochastic equations are few. Instead, the academic community has and continues to brush off these factors with the wrongly conceptualized idea that the sum total of all human interactions will create Brownian Motion. The billions of collisions on a grain of pollen in H<sub>2</sub>O are what stirred the creation of this type of stochastic process. So, the question is: Can we equate the process which creates Browian Motion as observed by Brown himself, to the structure of asset price movement? One is created through thermal random thermal interactions; the other through human emotion, psychology, and behaviour.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Risk managers should realize these assumptions and they should be cautious.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If risk managers believe in the predicatablity of prices, then we must, by force of principle assume that there is an underlying structure. In other words, consider the prediction of Earthquakes. The fact that we even consider the ability to predict their occurrence suggests that we have some degree of knowledge regarding their underlying structure. By believing in the predictability of price trajectories, we naturally assume some underlying structure. But what is this structure? How do we monitor the processes at work?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Are returns predictable? According to much research, the answer to this question is a firm, yes. But arbitrage theory says that such predicatablity can not exist. So, what does the risk manager believe? Does he believe that prices are Brownian Motions; that markets are efficient machines, not affected by the emotions, psychology, and behavior of humans; or does he disregard these assumptions in search for a better stochastic model? The answer to this question lies in controversy and may not be resolved for a long time. However, the risk manager has 100 billion of assets which he must manage today. Where is he to look for alternative models which disregard the assumptions of his collegues and predecessors? This paper provides the beginning of one such alternative.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This paper presents a stochastic model of the form: change(price) = function(volume). The volume depends on a matrix with a fixed number of agents. The intuition behind this model comes from the concept that a stock price&#8217;s movement should reflect not a normal distribution, which has roots in the idea of Brownian motion and particles in heat transfer, but rather a bi-directional &#8220;tug-of-war&#8221; between agents who are buying and selling with human emotions, psychology, and behavior. Just as in the youthful tug-of-war game, there are times when it appears that the right side has the upper hand, when, all of the sudden the left side makes a determined effort and brings down the right side. These drastic and rapid phase transitions are unheard of in a Brownian idea of price movements. The Brownian application to asset price movements provide a decent first approximation. However, stochastic processes with Brownian Motion will never evolve in a manner to explain the stylized facts observed from the actual distribution of asset returns. Thus, to truly model price behavior, practitioners should study the fundamental structure of the market.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Consider this thought experiment:&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Take a snapshot of all market participants in a security XYZ. This is period zero (t = 0). Suppose there are a fixed number, N, total people in the financial system who can own and trade XYZ. In other words, the price movement of this asset should depend only on the actions of these N traders. Now count the number of traders who currently hold a short position in XYZ and a long position in XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub>and L<sub>0</sub> represent the number of traders who are currently short and long, respectively, the asset XYZ. Let S<sub>0</sub> + L<sub>0</sub>&lt; N, thus there are a number of traders, H<sub>0</sub>, who hold neither a short nor a long position. Thus, H<sub>0</sub> = N – S<sub>0</sub>– L<sub>0</sub>. The current price of XYZ is P<sub>0</sub>. Assume that all transactions only involve 1 share of XYZ. Further posts will seek to address the important consideration of number of shares.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now consider the next possible moves for all traders in the market (t = 1). There are assumed to be four possibilities:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">An XYZ owner with a long position sells. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A trader short XYZ covers his/her position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> – 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>+ 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a long position. (L<sub>1</sub> = L<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0</sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A neutral trader initiates a short position. (S<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>0</sub> + 1 and H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>0 </sub>&#8211; 1)</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, numbers 1 and 2 increase the number of neutral traders, while 3 and 4 decrease that number. Assume that both 2 and 3 cause the price of XYZ to increase by some factor and 1 and 4 decrease the price of XYZ by the same factor. Thus the movement of the price of XYZ should be a bi-directional “tug-of-war” battle: traders going long and shorts covering versus traders shorting and longs selling.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">To represent this computationally, a matrix can be created which holds the current state of all traders. To create the initial state matrix, called StateMatrix<sub>0</sub>, form an <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N x <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">√</span>N square matrix (for simplification, it would be best to choose N as a perfect square). Then fill the matrix randomly with the value -1 for the correct number of traders short XYZ, S<sub>0</sub>. Do likewise with L<sub>0</sub>and H<sub>0</sub>, represented by 1 and 0, respectively. Thus, the initial StateMatrix<sub>0</sub> will be randomly filled with {-1,0,1}, representing the traders who are short, neutral, and long.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Now, proceed one period to t = 1. To calculate the next StateMatix<sub>1</sub>, do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Assume that each trader is influenced by U of his peers and that this influence is proportional to a factor representing the general market “mood.” Call the mood factor for the current period, M<sub>t</sub>. To find what the trader will do in the transition from t = 0 to t =1, sum the values of his U neighbors, find their average, multiply by the current M<sub>t</sub> and round. In addition, include a possibility for&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;to form his own&nbsp;independent value {-1,0,1} and ignore his U neighbors with probability, IDIO (an idiosyncratic change of asset position).</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For example, suppose that at t = 0, trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> of the matrix was short, i.e. the value was -1 and that his 4 neighbors at i = 0 had values {1,0,1,-1}.&nbsp;Suppose the M<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;at this time is 1.2 and IDIO = 0.20. If this&nbsp;trader<sub>[i,j]</sub>&nbsp;does not choose an idiosyncratic position, then he mimics his neighbors.&nbsp;The sum of his four neighbors is thus&nbsp;SumTrader<sub>[i,j]</sub> = 1 + 0 + 1 – 1 = 1 and the average is ¼. Thus ¼*1.2 = 0.3. Rounding give a value of 0. Thus, the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> should change his value to 0, in other words the trader<sub>[i,j]</sub> will cover his position.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Performing this calculation for every trader on the grid will create the StateMatrix<sub>1</sub>. And doing this for T periods will create a&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence of trader states. To calculate the actual price movement based on this&nbsp;model do the following:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></div>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sum over all values of trader<sub>[i,j]&nbsp;</sub>of&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Calculate the difference,&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t+1</sub>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>and divide by N. Multiply by P<sub>t</sub>. This value = C, the change in the price from the previous price</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Price<sub>t+1</sub> = Price<sub>t</sub>+ C</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">This will form the evolution of the price through the states of the&nbsp;StateMatrix<sub>{t=[0,T]}</sub>&nbsp;sequence.  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">Note: In order to make the M<sub>t</sub>factor suitable, its values must fall between [0,1.5). If not, then values of the traders<sub>[i,j]</sub> may be other than {-1,0,1}. The M<sub>t</sub> factor can be calculated at each period with the following calculation:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">M<sub>t</sub>&nbsp;= #L<sub>t-1</sub>/#S<sub>t-1</sub></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the Mood factor M<sub>t</sub>for the next period is the ratio of the number of current traders who are long to the number of current traders who are short. There may be other ways to define this factor.</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Look at the previous <a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2013/11/simulated-stock-price-data-ising-type.html" target="_blank">post, here</a>, to see an example. In that post I used:</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">N = 1,000,000</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">T = 700</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">U = 4</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">L<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0.4*N</div>
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">IDIO = 0.19</div>
