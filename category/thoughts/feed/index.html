				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Order can exist without a hierarchy, yet I constantly confront the word <em>anarchy</em> in contexts which assume its manipulated definition of disorder. This association degrades the ideas of political anarchists. To remedy this issue, I propose a new word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Autocosmocracy &#8211; a form of society in which the political relations between its members, without the aide of any hierarchical institution, continually gives rise to a self-organized society. A continuously existing society without a higher power structure; a system where authority lies in the absolute freedom of the individual. All members are autonomous agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The world of the biologist is filled with organisms which are self-organized. In the natural sciences there are numerous phenomena in which order arises out of agents acting autonomously. Is not man himself a biological creature in the physical world?</p>
<p>Imagine a hypothetical situation where the form of civilization is an autocosmocracy &#8212; all individuals completely autonomous, bound by no institution. I would postulate that inevitably, after a certain number of generations, the civilization would form groups due to scarcity; and that these distinct groups will form their own government. These new groups will throw away the autocosmocratic forms and create novel political frameworks in order to achieve various goals. For instance, there is great dominating strength in having a mass of brutish men who will obey all commands unquestioningly. In other words, in an initial state of complete freedom and liberty, humans will group and band together. It can be shown mathematically that this will be the equilibrium state. Those individuals who fail to join a group will be out competed or destroyed by those who do join a group.</p>
<p>A similar situation occurs in the distributed cryptocurrency mining networks. This system, which is initially distributed with all individual miners acting autonomously, inevitably transforms into a network of groups due to competition and scarcity. So the natural question arises: how to prevent the formation of such groups in the presence of scarcity? Or is it a better question to ask how to eliminate scarcity?</p>
<p>In terms of Plato&#8217;s cave of shadows, it would be a society in which all members are able to discover the source of the shadows. All members would exist as philosopher kings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Capitalism does not require corporations.</li>
<li>Corporations do not strictly require capitalism.</li>
<li>Among other requirements, corporations need laws protecting private property.</li>
<li>Corporations are the offspring of limited liability contracts; they are founded with the idea that people, working together, can share the risks and burdens required in a business enterprise.</li>
<li>Corporations encourage the joint ownership of property. Through this shared ownership, combining knowledge and skills of the many, people can transform their property into a means of production more advanced than they could have done individually.</li>
<li>Corporations compete with other corporations and entities. However, the modern definition of &#8220;compete&#8221; tends to be dominated by rivalry; instead, we should enact laws which emphasize the etymology of the word &#8220;compete&#8221;: Late Latin <em>competere</em> &#8220;strive in common,&#8221; in classical Latin: &#8220;to come together, agree, to be qualified,&#8221; later, &#8220;strive together,&#8221; from <em>com-</em> &#8220;together&#8221; (see com-) + <em>petere</em> &#8220;to strive, seek, fall upon, rush at, attack&#8221;</li>
<li>Corporations do not require a hierarchy. It is a misconception to think that a corporation&#8217;s only form of internal structure is that of a hierarchy.</li>
<li>We can begin the restructuring of modern society with the restructuring of corporations: A mandate to outlaw or limit hierarchical corporate structures. One such replacement: p<em>rimus inter pares</em>.</li>
<li><em>Primus inter pares</em>: first among equals, as Robert Greenleaf suggested in his book <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2013/01/servant-leadership-robert-k-greenleaf/" target="_blank">Servant Leadership</a>. The structure can be such that all employees are equal owners.</li>
<li>There are already some employee owned corporations; although they may not have a <em>primus inter pares</em> structure or equal ownership&#8230; <a href="http://www.nceo.org/articles/employee-ownership-100" target="_blank">See the list from NCEO</a>. Support them and boycott the hierarchies!</li>
<li>The cannabis industry (and any other new industry) provides the perfect opportunity to create corporations with novel structures.</li>
<li>Corporations have political power. In effect, consumers grant political authority to producers. A consumer, by purchasing from a given producer, indirectly votes and empowers that producer to continue its existence as both a producer and political power.</li>
<li>A consumer, given the choice to purchase a similar product among various producers, can make an aware political decision to support the producer aligned with his/her personal beliefs &#8212; Price be damned!</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/wikileaks_accuses_facebook_of_censhorship_20160318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikileaks recently claimed</a> that Facebook censored their post on Hillary Clinton&#8217;s email dump. This suggests that users of Facebook are in no way guaranteed the right to post whatever they want. At the end of the day, it is Facebook Corporation (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quote: FB</a>) which has the final say on what should be publicly allowed on Facebook. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, this is the expected outcome of a free service existing as a centrally managed set of servers owned by special interests and shareholders.</p>
<p>The solution, not without its own disadvantages, would be to create and migrate all users to a decentralized social media network. I think this would be possible with <a href="https://namecoin.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecoin </a>in combination with WordPress (think <a href="https://buddypress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuddyPress</a>) where all users would have their own local servers or rent machines with services like Heroku, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/hosting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a>, <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/running-wordpress-on-openshift-an-introduction--cms-20058" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Openshift</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EC2</a>, etc.. The process should be simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>User rents machine on Heroku, Namecheap, Openshift, etc&#8230;</li>
<li>Install WordPress on this machine</li>
<li>Add WordPress social network plugin</li>
<li>Create Namecoin domain</li>
<li>Create user profile</li>
<li>Publish posts, socialize and message friends</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some current examples/ideas of people creating and implementing P2P social networks:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; the non-coding sequences have certain statistical features in common with natural and artificial languages. Specifically, we adapt to DNA the Zipf approach to analyzing linguistic texts. These statistical properties of non-coding sequences support the possibility that non-coding regions of DNA may carry biological information.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that quote in mind, consider that Francis Crick <a href="http://ofbacteriaandmen.blogspot.com/2012/08/francis-crick-and-directed-panspermia.html" target="_blank">suggested in 1975</a> that life on Earth could have been the result of &#8220;Directed Panspermia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/cosmic-serpent-dna-and-the-origins-of-knowledge-jeremy-narby/">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge </a>for Jeremy Narby’s thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p>Messages in DNA? Directed Panspermia? Great ideas for a science fiction movie, yes! But unless scientists find evidence that life definitely arose on Earth through natural processes, then these ideas can and should be considered legitimate hypotheses &#8212; they both can be refuted by evidence showing that they are false.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s entertain the rather wild possibility that the information contained in these non-coding regions may in fact be information encoded in the DNA by an advanced &#8220;thing&#8221; which purposely sent life to Earth. This would suggest the question: &#8220;At what level of development did cells and bacteria arrive on Earth?&#8221; Fully developed with DNA, ribosomes, and protein synthesis? Or, perhaps just DNA contained in a capsule?</p>
<p>If an advanced intelligence wanted to send a message to be received by an organism which eventually developed enough ability to discover this message, how would it do this? What would the message be? What would be the context of the message?</p>
<p>Would it be possible to encode a message as &#8220;form&#8221; in matter. By form, I mean something like studying the processes and relationships of molecular biology, for instance see: <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2016/01/the-molecular-basis-of-life/">The Molecular Basis of Life</a>. The incredible form of the DNA transcription; the fascinating ability of the kinesin protein to travel microtubules; could these forms and relationships be the message? If the context is biological travel in space, might these cellular forms and relationships be teaching us how to expand and develop in space?</p>
<p>But a message based on form seems to be invalid because it is the non-coding regions of DNA which are not expressed in protein structures that contain the statistical properties of Zipf. However, I think we still have much to learn about DNA and its interactions with the rest of the cell which may change the way we view DNA. It just seems hard for me to understand how 1,000,000 specially crafted objects (proteins) of various shapes thrown in a zero gravity room together could somehow bounce and collide to eventually create an organized dynamic transport mechanism across that same room &#8212; not to mention the dozens of other cellular processes. So, where does the form of cellular processes arise?</p>
<p>These thoughts came as I was watching 3D animations of kinesin protein travel along microtubules. Perhaps we could design a sort of kinesin vehicle which would travel along a microtubule connection from the Earth to Moon? Or, they could serve as connections between asteroid space bases suspended in the Lagrangian points. No need for rocket fuel, it would be similar to magnetic trains. What would it imply if an idea for space travel and transport could be found inside the cell?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Would it be possible to establish a limited partnership which has the sole mandate to restructure the boards of public corporations simply for public welfare? Or is this idea just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Most &#8220;activist&#8221; investors and funds are simply trying to change corporate boards for self-interest, their goal being to induce a new executive team to increase profitability, free cash flow, product diversity, etc&#8230; Most likely the purpose of these activists is to make changes which will result in a large long term gain with a nice 15% tax rate. But, what I am suggesting has no goal other than to raise enough funds to accumulate an ownership stake which will allow a board take-over of a large corporation.</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects of this fund would be that it&#8217;s goal would not be in any way to earn investors a profit. Thus, all contributions to join the partnership would be subject to complete loss. Any gains or losses would be given back or incurred to the donors after the mandate has been achieved. Once the mandate is complete, the partnership would be dissolved. This could take 1 year or 10 years depending on the situation in the corporation.</p>
<p>Starting anew would ensure that any managers would not be corrupted. Fees would be minimal. No one managing this fund would make any more than a living wage. However, there will be legal and other such fees which are unavoidable.</p>
<p>For instance, if 10 million people invested $3,000 in this partnership, the total of $30 billion would be sufficient to slowly accumulate a controlling interest in the corporation. Once the controlling interest is achieved, the board of directors would be replace by the desired men and women. This new board would then replace the executive team to create a new culture for the corporation to ensure the mandate is achieved.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know what you think&#8230; constantly trying to think of ways to improve/fix our existing system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe the developed world has the potential knowledge and power to prevent a large scale religious war in the Middle East which threatens to involve numerous superpowers. For the sake of all civilization, we must force a peaceful resolution. There is a hope that our technology has enabled us to predict and even prevent global disasters. Sadly, I have the impression that there are people and groups in power who are rather intent upon war, regardless of predictions. Or they are at least not supporting a peaceful resolution. Their very refusal to step down or change their strategy is in fact the problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps they don&#8217;t realize that most developed economies, including the United States, Europe and Japan are in dis-integrative secular cycles. Any global fighting will only accelerate the descent into local unrest and civil dissidence in the developed economies. It is important to remember that World World II began around ten years after the start of the Great Depression. The current global depression, yes depression (not recession), occurred about seven years ago. History does progress in cycles, not necessarily at periodic intervals, but the highest probability of global war is in the years following a global depression. Martin Armstrong has mentioned that November 20, 2014 was a critical date in his war cycle and that <a href="//armstrongeconomics.com/cycle-of-war-political-economy/" target="_blank">2015 and 2016 are going to be volatile years</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="//www.thebubbleindex.com/" target="_blank">The Bubble Index</a> (10,080 and 20,160 days), shows that the DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are both still in large scale decompression phases which started in 2008-9. Similar decompression phases in The Bubble Index occurred in the late 1960&#8217;s and lasted through the 1970&#8217;s. This marked a time of great civil unrest. And if you are an Elliott Wave follower, <a href="//danericselliottwaves.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Daneric&#8217;s blog</a> suggests the recent bull market is a &#8220;sucker&#8217;s rally&#8221; B wave off the 2009 lows, and that a C wave is about to unfold in the Wilshire 5000 (although there are other EW blogs, such as <a href="//caldaro.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Caldaro</a>, which predict different outcomes). If these predictions come true we are looking at a future in the next few years of political unrest and economic volatility. Only time will tell&#8230;</p>

It was of a dwelling which contained numerous murals painted by the Maya. Thought to be 1,200 years old, it contains some interesting depictions. Especially a picture of three black men, who are apparently wearing white medallions and black headdresses. When I first saw this, I thought: &#8220;Why does a Mayan mural have three African men with ivory medallions wearing &#8220;Pharaoh&#8221; type headdresses?&#8221; I am not sure; could it be that the Maya had a special desire to paint themselves black, perhaps like a panther? Or is this evidence of a connection with Africa?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big reason why it is so hard to fix and respond to environmental crises is the fact that societies lack a means to store ecological value in a monetary form. As a result, in the never-ending pursuit of growth and technological progress we rarely consider the growth and progress of other species. But how can we? Population statistics, ecological value, and other detailed data are rare or non-existent. We have very little quantitative data on the thousands of other species. And we don&#8217;t care. The average citizen can barely find time to consider the fate of the Rhino when he/she works 10 hours a day. We are stuck in fifth gear &#8212; moving full speed into the future despite the dire consequences of ignorance and a failure to act. The current relationship between humanity and the biosphere is reminiscent of parasitism or cancer. I just hope we are not yet in stage 4. Despite the reliance of our survival on other species, we continually threaten their existence &#8212; and indirectly our own.</p>
<p>The solution to the impending crises lies in a change of perception. The often quoted &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; ideology tends to cause people to forget about another important form of evolution &#8212; symbiosis. Cancer is the extreme version of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; and parasitism at the cellular level. Cooperation through symbiosis however, is working together to get the job done (mitochrondria and the endosymbiotic theory). If we change the way we view nature, from &#8220;Man versus Nature&#8221; to &#8220;Man with Nature,&#8221; our problems will begin to vanish. The conception of the future will turn from a dismal apocalyptic world to one of harmonious mutualism. A symbiotic biological cooperation between our species and the other species of Earth, who are at our mercy, will forever change the course of history. The importance of symbiosis is becoming increasingly clear as a powerful survival mechanism in biological evolution and the future of <i>homo sapiens</i> may depend on its acceptance.</p>
<p>Brainstorming ways to establish a framework which intimately connects the economics of humans with that of their relatives in a symbiotic relationship, I believe one solution could be via the market. It involves creating a new asset class. By establishing shares of stock in species (or family/order) and having these shares trade in an exchange, the success of other species now becomes a potentially profitable industry for humans. At the same time benefiting the non-human species. Similar to humans trading shares of stock with theoretical values based on the work potential of organizations of labor producing members, the trading of species shares would be based upon the ecological value of biological organisms.</p>
<p>This Species Xchange would provide a means to store human labor potential (money) in the data collection, protection, monitoring, preservation, and development of any number of species. This funding would be initiated through an IPO for each species. I believe this would be symbiosis at its finest.&nbsp;Including other species in our financial decision making&nbsp;would fundamentally change the relationship humans have with their biological relatives. &nbsp;By&nbsp;protecting the species humans rely on for ecological harmony, while at the same time providing them with a more &#8220;bio-diverse&#8221; basket of eggs to store their labor potential would, in effect, create a more dynamic and powerful investment system.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Since these shares would lack the legal power characteristic of corporate shares, the Species Xchange organization would guarantee the price per share. This guaranteed price per share would be calculated based on species reports published on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, similar to how corporations release 10K and 10Q reports. The calculation would be based upon various statistical and environmental attributes of the species, determined by experts, suitable for maintaining the harmony of the total ecological system. And this price could increase or decrease from quarter to quarter; depending on how the specific factors change. The only way the shares would be valueless, similar to corporate bankruptcy, was if the species went extinct &#8212; in effect providing a strong incentive to keep the species alive and prosperous.</p>
<p>The money raised in the IPO would go towards all manner of initiatives to fund and support the species. It would be managed by a group of people in a <i>primus inter pares</i> form of management. The goal of management would be to spend the money in such a way as to increase the value of the species in relation to all other species. This could include population measurement and control, biological research on the life cycle of the species, detailed studies on the role in the overall ecological network, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say 100 million shares of <i>Macropus Rufus</i> are issued to the public. The IPO is priced at $20 per share. Thus, proceeds of $2 billion would go towards a fund established for the <i>Macropus Rufus</i> species. At the end of each quarter, a species report would be released detailing any changes in population, biological discoveries, and other details related to the status of the species. After each report, a new guaranteed price would be established by a set formula. Let&#8217;s say that new price is $22.50. Fast-forward through time and imagine a set of guaranteed prices: $22.50, $22.80, $21.00, $22.10, $25.00, etc&#8230; The set of guaranteed prices would form a set of lower bounds for the price series. The only reason an investor would redeem the shares would be in the event of an arbitrage if the price fell below the lower bound. However, it remains to be determined whether this would actually happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps all this seems silly, like something out of science fiction, and not feasible. Even though I would disagree, I think it is at least a step in the right direction. If more people can brainstorm practical ideas which join together humans and other species in a symbiotic relationship with current institutions, we may have a chance at preventing a catastrophic change in the biosphere. Harmony and balance can be restored with the right combination of creativity and institutional power.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems to be entirely possible, and even beneficial, if there was an exchange, analogous to the NYSE, where traders and investors could buy and sell &#8220;shares&#8221; of a species. The exchange would begin by issuing an IPO on every species. For example, ticker symbol: QA could be the &#8220;stock&#8221; for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercus_alba" target="_blank"><i>Quercus alba</i></a>.</p>
<p>We need to think outside the box to protect our environment and I see this a way to benefit both man and nature. Man will be awarded with more assets with which he can diversify his financial holdings; nature will win in various ways &#8212; including the proceeds of the IPO to protect the species.</p>
<p>This would be initiated to test the idea that a traded asset can be something more general than an organization consisting of human labor and assets.</p>
<p>You may argue that a stock must have a fundamental basis in the value of human commodities and labor. That may be true, however, what limits the definition extending to non-human commodities and the labor of nature? In any case, for the experienced investors, how many companies have you seen being valued in the billions with little or no assets and no profits? In fact, a species actually has an enormous value and potential in terms of biology, ecology, and the sustainability of human activity.</p>
<p>There are numerous possible arguments against this, which I would enjoy countering. Perhaps I will devote more to this in a future post.</p>
