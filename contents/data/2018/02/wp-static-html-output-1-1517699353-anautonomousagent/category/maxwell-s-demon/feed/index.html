<div style="text-align: justify;"><i><a href="//amzn.com/0195121058" target="_blank">Investigations</a>&nbsp;</i>seems to be a further expansion of the ideas presented in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman" target="_blank">Kauffman&#8217;s</a> book <i>Origins of Order </i>(<a href="//ttrott.blogspot.com/2012/12/origins-of-order-stuart-kauffman.html" target="_blank">see other post</a>). As a note, I found that both are very dense and hard to read. However, the concepts presented within are worth the effort. The book provides a novel approach at explaining the origins of life. I found the most fascinating concepts in the novel to be the Adjacent Possible and the idea of Autonomous Agents.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">An Autonomous Agent is simply a system which reproduces itself and carries out a work cycle.</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The idea of an Adjacent Possible shines light on the idea of entropy in the universe. <i>Investigations</i>&nbsp;contains an entire section talking about Maxwell&#8217;s Demon and the nonergodicity (see <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis" target="_blank">ergodic hypothesis</a>) of the universe. Briefly, the Adjacent Possible is the set of all &#8220;next&#8221; states of the universe. To give an example, consider the early universe. Consisting almost entirely of Hydrogen and Helium, we would say that the universe was in a &#8220;Actual State&#8221; of Hydrogen and Helium. The Adjacent Possible of chemicals would be the empty set &#8212; that is, no chemical states can be &#8220;formed&#8221; from Hydrogen and Helium (gravity has yet to create stars). &nbsp;Then, once stars began to form, the Adjacent Possible began to include more states; elements like Carbon and Oxygen are the &#8220;next&#8221; states in the interior of stars under the right temperature and pressures. &nbsp;Fast forward billions of years and human organisms are creating &#8220;next&#8221; states in the chemical Adjacent Possible (assuming alien civilizations have not already created these states). For example, humans have created nylon, plastic, Teflon, and various other molecular states. &nbsp;These states would have been considered elements of the Adjacent Possible in the early 20th century; now, they are elements of the &#8220;Actual State&#8221; of the universe.</div>
<p><a href="//anautonomousagent.com/contents/data/2012/12/adjacent-possible.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="//anautonomousagent.com/contents/data/2012/12/adjacent-possible.gif" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the universe can be considered nonergodic. It has yet to explore, and most likely will not explore, a large portion of the possible states of the universe.</div>
<p>Kauffman also talks about economics. He explains that modern economic theories fail to predict and account for the&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;innovation of human &#8220;goods&#8221; into the Adjacent Possible of &#8220;goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would highly recommend <i>Investigations. </i>It really is a must read! (ISBN-13: 978-0195121056)</p>
