				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me provide a context so that you may understand my amazement with the chemical explorations of Alexander Shulgin. Did you know that the two principal neurotransmitters in the human body are dopamine and serotonin? Did you know that they belong to the phenethylamine and tryptamine chemical families, respectively? I find this simple observation to be of fundamental importance in understanding the human mind/body relationship. And now consider that Ann and Alex Shulgins&#8217; books: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL">PiKHAL</a> (Phenethylamines I have known and loved) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiHKAL">TiKHAL</a> (Tryptamines I have known and loved) explore both these chemical families and their effects on the human mind and body. Quick summary of well-known psychedelic chemicals:</p>
<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Phenethylamines</th>
<th>Tryptamines</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">Dopamine</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin">Serotonin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mescaline">Mescaline</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine">MDA</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin">Psilocybin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA">MDMA</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocin">Psilocin</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C_(psychedelics)">2C Family</a></td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine">Ibogaine</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a>?</td>
<td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>LSD is complex and has both chemical structures, but most people emphasize that the effects of LSD are related primarily to its tryptamine backbone and interaction with human serotonin receptors.</p>
<p>Ann and Alexander Shulgin&#8217;s books are a groundbreaking revelation for their accounts of psychedelic exploration, therapy, and spiritual development. They are a mix of essays and stories. You will not regret reading the books and learning about the chemicals referenced in the second half of the books.</p>
<p>An interesting note: In PiKHAL, the fictional character Adam Fisher is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Zeff">Leo Zeff</a>, a talented psychotherapist who worked with MDMA; you can read all about his therapy work in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2750163-the-secret-chief-revealed">The Secret Chief Revealed</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Stolaroff">Myron J. Stolaroff</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned of Jeremy Narby&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge</a> while reading Graham Hancock&#8217;s book, <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/11/supernatural-graham-hancock/" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>. The ideas present within both books are incredible. DNA may be an extra-terrestrial biotechnology. Of course, you don&#8217;t have to read these books to come to that conclusion. Narby further suggests that DNA actually has a mysterious way to communicate with the conscious awareness of all life, especially after the consumption of various consciousness altering molecules. It is through this alteration of the brain that life is able to receive a mysterious informational signal from DNA. Even if his hypothesis turns out to be false, the sheer intellectual creativity of Narby&#8217;s work deserves praise. As wild as that sounds, it really would not be surprising given the complexity and probability arguments presented by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" target="_blank">panspermia</a> supporters (Francis Crick for instance and also see: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6739" target="_blank">The &#8220;Wow! signal&#8221; of the terrestrial genetic code</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graham Hancock&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/1932857842" target="_blank">Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind</a> is a great synthesis of various ideas regarding the origin of religion, the visions of shamans, UFO encounters, DMT, elves, fairies and other supernatural phenomenon. I recently read <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/dmt-the-spirit-molecule-rick-strassman-m-d/" target="_blank">Rick Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a> and <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2015/10/ayahuasca-medicine-alan-shoemaker/" target="_blank">Alan Shoemaker&#8217;s Ayahuasca Medicine</a>. Thus, I had background knowledge on some of these subjects. This did not prepare me for the incredible connections made by Hancock.</p>
<p>Some of Hancock&#8217;s previous books, like Heavens Mirror, Fingerprints of Gods, Sign and Seal, and Underworld, I read and enjoyed more than seven years ago. I saw Supernatural when it came out in mid 2000&#8217;s, but I was not interested. At the time I thought, &#8220;Clearly Hancock has gone too far into the abyss of crazy.&#8221; It took me more than ten years to mature and discover the greatness of this work. I must say that Hancock does an incredible job and I can not wait to read his newest book, releasing in a few days. Supernatural has the power to shape your perceptions of reality and everything you thought you knew and understood. It is not to be taken lightly and I would suggest first reading Strassman&#8217;s DMT: The Spirit Molecule and perhaps even <a href="http://amzn.com/0874779642" target="_blank">Jeremy Narby&#8217;s The Cosmic Serpent</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a kid, I remember being confused as to why adults would drink beer and alcohol. The terrible taste was clearly the body&#8217;s survival mechanism telling yourself to avoid the poison. And it made people act strange. So why did they drink it? Once I entered college, I soon discovered why this foul beverage was so popular. Moderation and measure is the key to alcohol. Interestingly, I find myself in the same situation, learning of another, even more notoriously nasty beverage: Ayahuasca. Except in this case, the beverage is known as the ultimate medicine. The fascinating tales of the spirit world associated with this beverage make it an extreme curiosity.  I read Alan Shoemaker&#8217;s book, <a href="http://amzn.com/1620551934" target="_blank">Ayahuasca Medicine</a> with a deep interest and open mind about the shamanic traditions of the Amazon curanderos (I also just learned of the <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150721134827.htm" target="_blank">genetic connection between some Amazon tribes and the Aborigines</a>). Shoemaker has a remarkable tale to tell to the world and we should listen carefully.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terence McKenna&#8217;s experiences with the DMT molecule piqued my already curious mind. Talking with Elves? Hyperspace travel and other dimensions? Mystical visions? Was McKenna a deranged urban shaman luring others into the world of psychedelia? I decided to investigate by first reading a book. This was Rick Strassman&#8217;s, <a href="http://amzn.com/0892819278" target="_blank">DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a>. It is based on Strassman&#8217;s own research with human subjects on the effects of the DMT molecule from 1990 &#8211; 1995.</p>
<p>After finishing the book, I had a strong intuitive sense that McKenna was correct. Travelling to other dimensions, having a mystical experience, and talking to other beings are hallmarks of a DMT trip. The DMT molecule is a sort of high octane fuel for the brain which allows a higher level of conscious reality. Perhaps even accessing new forces and energies unknown to current science. Think of the 1820&#8217;s and 1830&#8217;s and the eventual realization during that period that the world is saturated with electromagnetic forces and fields. Then scientists found that the actual functioning of their brain relies on these forces which were previously unknown. Physics helped lead to discoveries in biology. Perhaps this time, the flow of discovery will be reversed &#8212; from biology to physics.</p>
<p>If DMT is the fuel, then the brain is the motor, the engine for visiting and travelling to indescribable places. In many ways the human body is the most sophisticated piece of technology which exists on this planet. It&#8217;s no wonder that many call it a temple. Perhaps it&#8217;s this natural technology which will enable humans to discover how to really travel to the stars. Or perhaps with better understanding of the DMT molecule we will more fully understand what it means to live and exist as a conscious being.</p>
<p>Brain biotechnology, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland" target="_blank">pineal gland</a>, may hold the key to understanding the holographic universe of Bohm. He was interested in which part of the brain played the role of accessing the holographic universe. Might the primary instrument be the pineal gland?</p>
<p>I was surprised to find, after reading many books on evolution, that no one really mentions the fact that our ancient common ancestors in the ocean, and eventually on land, had three eyes. The pineal gland, according to evolutionary biologists is today&#8217;s analogue to this ancient third sense organ. Indeed, many species today have what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">Parietal eye</a>. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">Tuatara</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">Triops</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye#Anatomy" target="_blank">extinct species as well</a>. This is a functioning organ in the human brain (technically not part of the brain &#8212; it forms from cells on the roof of the mouth) which has roots as a sense organ. Is it &#8220;sensing&#8221; today? Why has evolution migrated the organ to the center of the brain with immediate access to our nervous system? And what might be its function as  <a href="https://taobabe.wordpress.com/the-body-piezo-electric/" target="_blank">piezoelectric device</a>?</p>
<p>I would highly suggest reading Strassman&#8217;s book to enjoy the amazing experiences the volunteers described (as best they could). Even reading their experiences gave me chills and a sense of healing. This is a fascinating area of research and perhaps a new age of human existence will be born from it.</p>
