				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted here are three great lectures on cannabinoids and the Endocannabinoid System in the human body. The first lecture, by Dr. Robert Melamede is my favorite. Melamede frequently references Ilya Prigogine&#8217;s work and provides an understanding of the Endocannabinoid system based on a &#8220;far from equilibrium&#8221; perspective. For the more physics and math inclined readers, this is a wonderful connection.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Robert Melamede &#8211; Endocannabinoid System</strong></p>
<div id="iQprh5scuYY" class="youtube" style="width: 100%; height: 360px;"></div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>The Endocannabinoid System in Health and Disease &#8211; Dr. Ethan Russo</strong></p>
<div id="fGzG3-Mtmxk" class="youtube" style="width: 100%; height: 360px;"></div>
<p>Quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endocannabinoid System composed of three components: 1) endocannabinoids, 2) CB<sub>1</sub>, CB<sub>2</sub> and TRPV<sub>1</sub> receptors, and 3) regulatory enzymes</li>
<li>CB<sub>1</sub> is the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptor in the brain</li>
<li>Cannabinoids modulate how fast things move through the gut!</li>
<li>CB<sub>1</sub> is the &#8220;psychoactive receptor&#8221; and CB<sub>2</sub> is the immunomodulatory receptor</li>
<li>CBs 10-fold more potent than morphine in WDR neurons mediating pain</li>
<li>All humans have a baseline Endocannabinoid System, influenced by genetics or some life event; in some people the system becomes deficient &#8211; disease and other issues arise in the body</li>
<li>Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency (CED)</li>
<li>THC notoriously increases appetite, why aren&#8217;t users more often obese? THC alters the microfloral balance in gut, prevents weight gain</li>
<li>Cannabis very effective in Fibromyalgia</li>
<li>Migraine info at 41 min</li>
<li>Migraine related to CED</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cannabis and Cannabinoids &#8211; Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather</strong></p>
<div id="M8ieS2ICHME" class="youtube" style="width: 100%; height: 360px;"></div>
<p>Quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to the flower: oils, edibles and other extracts lose many of the cannabinoids and terpenes</li>
<li>Cannabis is an adaptogen &#8211; can give you whatever your body needs to regain its homeostasis</li>
<li>CBDs with THC works optimally, together it gives a greater than additive effect, i.e. better than consuming each individually; plant flower and all it contains is overall better than the extracts</li>
<li>At 1 hour and 2 min in the lecture, entire list of cancers which exhibit cannabinoid sensitivity and in many cases the tumor goes away with cannabinoid treatment</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Stanislav Grof&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.com/0285648829" target="_blank">Realms of the Human Unconscious: Observations from LSD Research</a> surpassed any expectations I had when I purchased it. It truly takes the reader on a trip into the most remote depths of the human psyche. Grof&#8217;s model of the unconscious, based on more than 30 years of experience, provides incredible insight into a realm beyond anything you thought you knew. The model involves what Grof calls &#8220;Systems of Condensed Experience&#8221; (COEX Systems). In addition to these experiences,  patients typically encounter experiences classified by Grof as either perinatal or transpersonal. I suggest reading the book to learn more about this topic and the models.</p>
<p>In a suitable analogy, Grof declares LSD to be psychiatry&#8217;s fundamental tool; it is like the astronomer&#8217;s telescope or the biologist&#8217;s microscope.  Grof refers to the powerful ability of LSD to facilitate the revealing of deep unconscious systems like that of sonar or radar, revealing the largest and most relevant emotional disturbances beneath the surface of the unconscious ocean. It allows therapists to have a direct reading of a patient&#8217;s relevant thought systems and important experiences. Readers begin to realize how incredibly important this molecule is for the well-being of the psyche and the spiritual and mental development of humanity.</p>
<p>For a simple introduction, I would suggest <a href="http://amzn.com/0062506595" target="_blank">The Holotropic Mind</a> rather than this book. Or if you prefer an audio book, Audible has <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Transpersonal-Vision-Audiobook/B002UZN2TO" target="_blank">The Transpersonal Vision</a>. I would also recommend joining the email list for the <a href="http://www.maps.org/" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS).</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching an <a href="https://youtu.be/6rgYz_BU2Ew" target="_blank">interview with Michael Talbot</a> on YouTube, I was eager to read his book, <a href="http://amzn.com/0062014102" target="_blank">The Holographic Universe</a>. Despite being published in 1991, the book contains a wide range of references and resources perfect for any reader in 2016 interested in the boundary between science and the paranormal. I recommend this book, not because it provides profound new insight, but because of the huge number of paranormal examples (if legitimate) and historical occurrences with which any reader may have a difficult time fitting into their framework of reality. Of course, it is unwise to accept anything you read as truth; however, the source material is listed and the reader can stroll down any path he/she wishes in their own personal investigation of these topics. My own path is now taking me into the work of Dr. Stanislav Grof,  Rick Strassman, etc&#8230; and topics such as LSD, DMT, NDEs and OBEs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terence McKenna&#8217;s experiences with the DMT molecule piqued my already curious mind. Talking with Elves? Hyperspace travel and other dimensions? Mystical visions? Was McKenna a deranged urban shaman luring others into the world of psychedelia? I decided to investigate by first reading a book. This was Rick Strassman&#8217;s, <a href="http://amzn.com/0892819278" target="_blank">DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a>. It is based on Strassman&#8217;s own research with human subjects on the effects of the DMT molecule from 1990 &#8211; 1995.</p>
<p>After finishing the book, I had a strong intuitive sense that McKenna was correct. Travelling to other dimensions, having a mystical experience, and talking to other beings are hallmarks of a DMT trip. The DMT molecule is a sort of high octane fuel for the brain which allows a higher level of conscious reality. Perhaps even accessing new forces and energies unknown to current science. Think of the 1820&#8217;s and 1830&#8217;s and the eventual realization during that period that the world is saturated with electromagnetic forces and fields. Then scientists found that the actual functioning of their brain relies on these forces which were previously unknown. Physics helped lead to discoveries in biology. Perhaps this time, the flow of discovery will be reversed &#8212; from biology to physics.</p>
<p>If DMT is the fuel, then the brain is the motor, the engine for visiting and travelling to indescribable places. In many ways the human body is the most sophisticated piece of technology which exists on this planet. It&#8217;s no wonder that many call it a temple. Perhaps it&#8217;s this natural technology which will enable humans to discover how to really travel to the stars. Or perhaps with better understanding of the DMT molecule we will more fully understand what it means to live and exist as a conscious being.</p>
<p>Brain biotechnology, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland" target="_blank">pineal gland</a>, may hold the key to understanding the holographic universe of Bohm. He was interested in which part of the brain played the role of accessing the holographic universe. Might the primary instrument be the pineal gland?</p>
<p>I was surprised to find, after reading many books on evolution, that no one really mentions the fact that our ancient common ancestors in the ocean, and eventually on land, had three eyes. The pineal gland, according to evolutionary biologists is today&#8217;s analogue to this ancient third sense organ. Indeed, many species today have what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">Parietal eye</a>. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara" target="_blank">Tuatara</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">Triops</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye#Anatomy" target="_blank">extinct species as well</a>. This is a functioning organ in the human brain (technically not part of the brain &#8212; it forms from cells on the roof of the mouth) which has roots as a sense organ. Is it &#8220;sensing&#8221; today? Why has evolution migrated the organ to the center of the brain with immediate access to our nervous system? And what might be its function as  <a href="https://taobabe.wordpress.com/the-body-piezo-electric/" target="_blank">piezoelectric device</a>?</p>
<p>I would highly suggest reading Strassman&#8217;s book to enjoy the amazing experiences the volunteers described (as best they could). Even reading their experiences gave me chills and a sense of healing. This is a fascinating area of research and perhaps a new age of human existence will be born from it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Before humans first landed on the moon, NASA scientists and academics spent years devising a solution to the moon landing problem. The problem is that humans are physically incapable of making correct logical conclusions under stochastic conditions not consistent with human evolution. A human would quickly get lost in the flood of information&nbsp;processing&nbsp;required to land a craft going 25,000 mph. The solution: programming a computer to make the landing control decisions. In other words, for the first time in human history the helmsman on the ship of exploration was not human. In other words, it was the computer which landed us on the moon. So, how are we really supposed to comprehend, &#8220;One small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">As a general conclusion, for things that require such decisions at such speeds or with huge numbers of parameters we need computers. In order to properly maintain a society as large as humans, there will come a time when we will have reached&nbsp;a limit to sustainable growth due to reaching the limits imposed by evolution on human decision making abilities. That time has already&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp;In order to continue to grow, we will have governments which rely on computer decisions to correctly sustain large numbers of people. However, this will raise the interesting situation in which the president or ruler of a country will be faced with a decision &#8211; it could be a political or social. Does he/she accept the outcome of the computer&#8217;s calculation or his own, human solution.</p>
<p>I guess nothing I have written should be surprising or new. However, my point is that governments of large nations are not really entirely run by humans.
