<p>Microfossils and Biomolecules in Meteorites &#8211; Dr. Richard B. Hoover</p>
<p>This video by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Hoover6">Dr. Richard B. Hoover</a> points at why I am so interested in meteorites. Imagine if Dr. Hoover is correct and that life pervades the universe, or even lets say a large galaxy and/or group of galaxies. This is a viable outcome of nature and follows from simple exponential growth given a time span on a scale of billions of years. As long as life has evolved to be able to travel the vast distances between stars this is a simple and interesting hypothesis. But we are of course mostly interested in complex life &#8212; we are scanning right now for complex information signals in all numbers of frequencies when all we have to do is study the meteorites already in our possession. If the universe is filled with single cell life forms, it would suggest that the potential of life to manifest itself in form/energy/matter such as humans or dinosaurs, etc.. exists as a latent potential throughout the region of the universe inhabited by these life forms. And complex life arises almost immediately when a new planet or moon with suitable conditions arises. This would basically be the answer to the Drake Equation. It is highly likely that there are other complex lifeforms. We now would feel confident to search for complex life signatures because we know now that the universe is filled with simple life and primitive multicelluar life like trilobites, dinosaurs, mammals, etc&#8230; So now the ultimate question would seem to be where did the first evolution of these organisms arise? In our galaxy? the Andromeda galaxy? Where exactly are Earth&#8217;s lifeforms on this larger tree of life? Reality is starting to seem like something out of a science fiction book.</p>
<p>Note, I have been photographing meteorites in cross polarized light for the past few years; including CO type meteorites. You can see my work at <a href="https://solaranamnesis.com/">Solar Anamnesis</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randall Carlson does a nice job explaining subjects which would otherwise be incredibly dense. I especially enjoyed this entire series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRcDAFHjDSg-bjFZevjMQYOZunJJ-K4k">Cosmography 101</a>. In this series he points out that ancient humans around the time of the last ice age appear to have been cosmographists. With this in mind he explores various scenarios of what might have occurred based on geological evidence. Once you finish hearing what Carlson presents I am certain you will know more than you wanted about the Younger Dryas. You will also encounter many comprehensive descriptions of comets and asteroids. Unfortunately for Carlson, his ideas on the events of the last ice age are an anathema to some of the worlds popular ideologies: those who hold a religious based on the Bible&#8217;s account of a supernatural guiding force and those who hold a scientific view based on gradualism. If you maintain a religious understanding, then the proof that these historical events occurred through purely physical interactions between material things following mathematical laws, then you will most likely close your attention to the evidence immediately. The same refusal will occur by those scientifically oriented who think their already correct view of this time era is true and scientifically valid. Dare to be challenged?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post-content">
<p>On page 306 of <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2018/04/scale-geoffrey-west/">Scale</a>, Geoffrey West discusses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbarâ€™s Law</a> and its implication for human social networks. To summarize this law: it claims that humans have multiple levels of bonding strength. At the lowest level a human will have around five connections of the strongest type of friendship and intimacy. Typically this would include some members of oneâ€™s family or a best friend. At the next level there are around fifteen connections that are not as strong as the first level, but are still firm. This would include close friends you might talk to on a daily or weekly basis. At the next level there are about fifty connectionsâ€¦ and so onâ€¦ The numbers of connections scales by tripling the connections at each higher level. In the book the levels are labeled as: 1) Kin, 2) Super-family 3) Clan, 4) Tribe, and 5) Strangers.</p>
<p>When I first read this in Scale, I was immediately reminded of David Graeberâ€™s anthropological work regarding economic relationships among humans. In his book <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2017/07/debt-the-first-5000-years-david-graeber/">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a>, Graeber observes on page 99-100 that baseline communism (sharing) follows a similar structure. Thus, using the terminology from above: At the kin level Graeber notes that there is much sharing between members and the relationship is baseline communism. Thus, you can extend this and map these economic relationships with those of Dunbarâ€™s Law: 1) Kin (~5 people) : Almost all sharing with very little debt or IOU, 2) Super-family (~15 people) : IOU with a good amount of sharing, 3) Clan (~ 50 people) : Mostly IOU and little sharing, and 4) Tribe (~150 people) : Almost entirely IOU with very little sharing. Anything outside the tribe would be exchange via a cash medium except in rare occasions, such as a child falling in front of an on-coming vehicle (a person would naturally share his strength to save the childâ€™s life). Although I may not have followed Graeberâ€™s observations exactly I find this train of thought to be interesting as it requires one to rethink the concept of currency, exchange, and economic relationships. Indeed, Graeberâ€™s book challenges the entire paradigm of the historical development of currency and debt by analyzing the anthropological record.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://a.co/0tTatb5">Scale</a>, by Geoffrey West, is a thought provoking book about coarse grained quantitative network theories which concern the entire human species and its interaction with the environment. Although verbose â€” as I think the intended audience is upper high school and entry-level college â€” it is clear in its depictions and explanations. This book is an important summary of really profound work and research performed at the Santa Fe Institute. And it is a great introduction to understanding power laws and scaling in biology and network topologies.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been following Bitcoin since 2011 but sadly never researched its technical foundations. A few weeks ago I decided to dive into the subject. <a href="http://a.co/4VbZiYq">Mastering Bitcoin</a>, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, clearly explains the fundamental designs of Bitcoin. The book is well written and an excellent entry point for developers new to the subject. Many sites and people recommend this book and rightly so, because after reading it, I feel that I have a new understanding and appreciation of everything blockchain related. While it is detailed and technical â€” geared towards an audience familiar with programming and Internet technologies, it can be a great resource for those wanting an intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>If you decide to purchase the book, make sure you do it on <a href="https://purse.io/shop">purse.io</a> with Bitcoin. Purse is now where I make any purchases for books or things I would have bought directly from Amazon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.anthonypeake.com/product/opening-the-doors-of-perception/">Opening the Doors of Perception</a>, Anthony Peake strings together research in epilepsy, migraines, autism,Â Alzheimerâ€™s disease, schizophrenia, and entheogens in an attempt to understand human consciousness. Are we living in a simulation? What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction">Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)</a> and what can it tell us about ourselves? How is it that flickering light can trigger an altered state of consciousness? What is the relationship between the Eidolon and the Daemon? These are just some of the questions pondered and developed by Peake. Opening the Doors of Perception provides the reader with some fascinating research which will hopefully open ones mind to some really powerful insights.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would be greatly beneficial to human communication freedom if we all worked together to create a decentralized blockchain wireless internet provider network. I think there are already at least two projects addressing this idea: <a href="https://www.dentwireless.com/whitepaper">DENT</a> and <a href="https://iungo.network/">IUNGO.NETWORK</a>. I am still reading the whitepapers for these projects. Before searching for existing projects based on this idea, I imagined a decentralized blockchain where each node in the network operates a wireless access point. And the data sent and received would be computed and deducted from a users wallet. Ideally, a person would be able to purchase a given amount of coins on an exchange which could then be used to exchange for a certain amount of wireless data. There are similarities with SIA coin, etcâ€¦ where the blockchain provides a decentralized service with security. The key is decentralization, anonymity, security, privacy, and freedom.</p>
<p>There are other options, but not what I have in mind: <a href="https://www.gotenna.com/pages/mesh">goTenna</a>, <a href="https://www.opengarden.com/firechat.html">FireChat</a>, etcâ€¦</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little bit of quantum physics, chemistry, biology and philosophy all rolled up into one important book. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/783285.Order_Out_of_Chaos"><em>Order Out of Chaos</em></a> (<em>La Nouvelle Alliance</em> as originally published in French) by Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers is a paradigm changing book. The first parts of the book are an excellent overview on the historical development of science &#8211; the evolution of dynamics and the discovery of thermodynamics and their relationship is particularly fascinating.</p>
<p>Once the reader gets to the later parts, it becomes somewhat abstract and the reader may not be able to get through it without a background in chemistry and physics. Chapter Nine, when the phrase &#8220;Order Out of Chaos&#8221; is developed, is difficult. Despite this, it is much more accessible than a scientific paper on the subject. It may take two or three reads to fully absorb the ideas presented. Overall it is one of my favorite reads.</p>
<p>Some important conclusions from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>The arrow of time objectively exists and it arises from non-equilibrium and irreversibility at the microscopic level.</li>
<li>The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics can be understood as a selection principal. It operates as a negative on allowable initial conditions, in other words it restricts systems with certain initial conditions from existing.</li>
<li>Time travel to the past is not allowed by thermodynamics because time reversal requires infinite information concerning the initial conditions of the system, an impossibility to an observer in the universe. This implies that information is closely connected to irreversibility and time.</li>
<li>Thermodynamics can be expressed from dynamics through the idea of correlations and internal-time operators. Thus, dynamics has been extended once again (general relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos theory).</li>
<li>The universe as a whole is in a non-equilibrium state and it is an irreversible process with pockets of reversible dynamics.</li>
<li>In general, one of the goals of the authors is to make dynamics and thermodynamics consistent with each other.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8URhgYos5fjHqFSO4RSIEg">Hidden Forces</a>, hosted by Demetri Kofinas is an nice set of interviews with various people on topics including: finance, complexity, mathematics, and cryptocurrencies. I struggled listening to some of the interviewees because I did not agree with their ideas or conclusions; but I guess it is good to have conflicting opinions in order to encourage debate in the comments and to help review one&#8217;s own opinions and understandings. Regardless, Kofinas provides a highly accessible medium through which advanced ideas can be grasped.</p>
<p>I first ran across Hidden Forces while listening to the <a href="https://youtu.be/NxERVnvHV4c">interview with Ray Monk</a> about philosophical mathematics. Monk&#8217;s narration on the work of Frege, Russell, Whitehead, Wittgenstein, and GÃ¶del is excellent &#8211; by far one of the clearest and easiest to grasp. It was learning about these paradigms and paradoxes of mathematics via <a href="https://anautonomousagent.com/2012/12/godel-escher-bach-douglas-hofstadter/">Hofstadter&#8217;s famous book</a> which led me to start this website.</p>
